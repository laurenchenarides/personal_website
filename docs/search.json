Understanding PEV depreciation trends in comparison to those of conventional gasoline vehicles (CVs) is critical for assessing PEV affordability and informing relevant policy, such as subsidies for used PEVs. We deliver comprehensive, high-resolution estimates of value retention rates at the make-model level in the United States for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and CVs using a database of 9 million used cars listed online between 2016 and 2022. While BEVs and PHEVs have depreciated at faster rates than CVs, this trend is changing, with newer model year BEVs and those with larger ranges have significantly higher retention rates than older model years with smaller ranges. Tesla BEVs are a notable exception following the opposite trend, with earlier model years holding their value better than newer model years. Subsidized BEVs in the new market are associated with lower prices for the same model in the resale market, with the $7,500 federal subsidy translating to a 3% lower resale price on average. Finally, disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic have affected affordability across all vehicles, with mean listing prices rising 37% and 39% for CVs and BEVs, respectively, from January 2020 to March 2022 in inflation-adjusted 2019 dollars.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{roberson2024,\n    author={Roberson, Laura A. and Pantha, Saurav and Helveston, John Paul},\n    title={Battery-powered bargains?

For transportation system simulations to produce realistic results, modelers need to incorporate these users and their choices. Choice-based conjoint surveys provide an attractive solution for obtaining flexible utility models that can be used to predict choices for a wide variety of trips. In this study, we demonstrate an example using conjoint survey data of commuter mode choice in the Washington, D.C. metro area (N = 1,651). We sample commuters who primarily drive and those that take transit. We examine preferences for different types of multi-modal trips, including those with intramodal and intermodel transfers. We find that trips involving a bus transfer are the least preferred while both drivers and transit users both value metro similarly to driving. We also find that walking during transit trips is an important barrier, with the travel time penalty for walking being 60% higher than that of time in a vehicle. Our findings highlight the significance of accounting for differences in modal transfer types in transportation system simulations. Reducing arrival time uncertainty was not a significant factor in commuter mode choice, and commuters’ value of time was similar across all vehicle types, suggesting that increasing the relative speed of transit modes may only have a marginal effect on commuter substitution away from personal vehicles.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{zhao2023using,\n  title={Using conjoint analysis to incorporate heterogeneous preferences into multimodal transit trip simulations},\n  author={Zhao, Lujin and Szajnfarber, Zoe and Broniatowski, David and Helveston, John Paul},\n  journal={Systems Engineering},\n  year={2023},\n  publisher={Wiley Online Library}\n}"

Although CVs, HEVs, and PHEVs are driven similarly, BEV cars average 4,477 fewer miles annually. Teslas are driven more than other BEVs, yet still less than CVs. Similar differences in VMT across powertrains exist for SUVs, though SUVs are driven more than cars in all powertrains. Driving range has a non-linear relationship with VMT for BEV cars: every 10 additional miles of range equates to 631 additional annual miles for low-range BEVs (&lt;100 miles of range) but only 85 annual miles for high-range BEVs (&gt;200 miles of range).

Using a national conjoint survey (N = 2,170 respondents), we quantify how U.S. vehicle buyers value different features of PEV financial incentives. Participants overwhelmingly prefer immediate rebates, on average valuing them by $580, $1,450, and $2,630 more than sales tax exemptions, tax credits, or tax deductions, respectively. These effects are significantly larger for lower-income households, used vehicle buyers, and buyers with lower budgets. We estimate that on average $2 billion could have been saved if the federal subsidy available between 2011 and 2019 were delivered as an immediate rebate instead of a tax credit, or $1,440 per PEV sold. Our results suggest that structuring incentives as immediate rebates would deliver a greater value to customers and would be more equitably distributed compared to the current tax credit scheme.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{roberson2022erl,\n    author={Roberson, Laura A. and Helveston, John Paul},\n    title={Not all subsidies are equal: Measuring preferences for electric vehicle financial incentives},\n    journal={Environmental Research Letters},\n    year={2022}, \n    volume={17},\n    number={8},\n    pages={084003},\n    doi = {10.1088/1748-9326/ac7df3}\n}"

It will also require collaboration with China, which has emerged as the global leader in the mass production of low-carbon energy technologies (LCETs). In part because of China’s investments in manufacturing, the LCETs required to meet climate targets have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuel sources (1). But some attribute China’s rapid rise in LCET sectors to unfair industrial policies—such as forced technology transfer requirements, massive subsidies, and outright intellectual property (IP) theft—aimed at strategically dominating the next generation of energy technologies (2). Trade relations between China and the world are currently unsettled, especially with the United States, a leading producer of both LCET research and development (R&D) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Against this backdrop, we outline why engaging with China is the more promising path to accelerate the global deployment of LCETs and to rapidly bring new technologies to mass production.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{helveston2019china,\n  title={China's key role in scaling low-carbon energy technologies},\n  author={Helveston, John and Nahm, Jonas},\n  journal={Science},\n  volume={366},\n  number={6467},\n  pages={794--796},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={American Association for the Advancement of Science}\n}"

Light-duty vehicle owners were asked in a series of choice tasks to choose among fuels that varied in type, price, CO2 emissions, and location of origin for a hypothetical vehicle that could accept all fuels. We find that the majority of gasoline and E85 users are willing to substitute towards other fuels at today’s prices and attributes, while diesel users have a strong preference for diesel fuel. We also find that respondents are willing to pay on average $150/ton CO2 avoided from fuel consumption—more than most estimates of the social cost of carbon. Thus, communicating the climate benefits from alternative fuels may be an important strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{helveston2019choice,\n  title={Choice at the pump: measuring preferences for lower-carbon combustion fuels},\n  author={Helveston, John P and Seki, Stephanie M and Min, Jihoon and Fairman, Evelyn and Boni, Arthur A and Michalek, Jeremy J and Azevedo, In{\\^e}s ML},\n  journal={Environmental Research Letters},\n  volume={14},\n  number={8},\n  pages={084035},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={IOP Publishing}\n}"

We find that with the combined bundle of attributes offered by vehicles available today, gasoline vehicles continue in both countries to be most attractive to consumers, and American respondents have significantly lower relative willingness-to-pay for BEV technology than Chinese respondents. While U.S. and Chinese subsidies are similar, favoring vehicles with larger battery packs, differences in consumer preferences lead to different outcomes. Our results suggest that with or without each country’s 2012–2013 subsidies, Chinese consumers are willing to adopt today’s BEVs and mid-range PHEVs at similar rates relative to their respective gasoline counterparts, whereas American consumers prefer low-range PHEVs despite subsidies. This implies potential for earlier BEV adoption in China, given adequate supply. While there are clear national security benefits for adoption of BEVs in China, the local and global social impact is unclear: With higher electricity generation emissions in China, a transition to BEVs may reduce oil consumption at the expense of increased air pollution and/or greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, demand from China could increase global incentives for electric vehicle technology development with the potential to reduce emissions in countries where electricity generation is associated with lower emissions.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{helveston2015will,\n  title={Will subsidies drive electric vehicle adoption?

    "section": "Reactivity",
    "text": "Reactivity\nOne other feature that is particularly powerful is the ability to use R code in your survey via Shiny’s reactive programming. This allows you to make your survey more interactive and to use the full power of R to create custom functionality.\n\nDemo 1: Displaying content based on previous responses\nLet’s say you wanted to create a survey that asked the respondent’s name, and then displayed a personalized message based on their name. You could do this by first asking their name:\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = \"text\",\n  id    = \"name\",\n  label = \"What is your name?\"\n)\n\nThen you can use the sd_display_value(\"name\") function to display the value of the name question in other parts of your survey. For example:\n\nWelcome, `r sd_display_value(\"name\")`!\n\nWhich would render as something like “Welcome, Dave!” (assuming the respondent entered “Dave” in the name question). This works because the sd_display_value() function is reactive, meaning it will update the display based on the respondent’s responses.\n\n\nDemo 2: Displaying randomized question labels\nLet’s say you wanted to show a series of questions, but you wanted to randomize the labels shown for each question. You could do this by first defining a list of labels, and then using the sd_question_reactive() function to create a question that will display a random label from the list.\nFor example, let’s ask the respondent to rate different car brands from a random set of brands. You could first pre-define the randomized sets of brands for each respondent and store it as a csv file, like this:\n\nbrands &lt;- c(\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Chevrolet\", \"Honda\", \"Nissan\", \"Tesla\")\ndesign &lt;- data.frame(\n  respondent_id = rep(1:10, each = 3),\n  brand = unlist(lapply(1:10, function(x) sample(brands, 3, replace = FALSE)))\n)\nwrite_csv(design, \"design.csv\")\n\nThis would make a design file that looks like this:\n\n\n  respondent_id     brand\n1             1     Honda\n2             1    Nissan\n3             1      Ford\n4             2      Ford\n5             2    Toyota\n6             2 Chevrolet\n\n\nNote that this would not be done in your survey.qmd file - it’s just a one-time thing to create the design (probably stored in an R file).\nThen in your server code chunk, you could read in the design file and use it to randomize the labels for each question based on a randomly chosen respondent:\n\ndesign &lt;- read_csv(\"design.csv\")\nresp_id &lt;- sample(design$respondent_id, 1)\ndf_resp &lt;- design %&gt;% filter(respondent_id == resp_id)\n\noptions &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nnames(options) &lt;- df_resp$brand\n\nsd_question_reactive(\n  type  = \"mc\",\n  id    = \"brands\",\n  label = \"Which of these brands do you like best?\",\n  option = options\n)\n\nHere the sd_question_reactive() function is used because the labels depend on the randomly chosen respondent. This means the labels will be different for each respondent.\nSince this is a reactive question, this code must be placed inside the server code chunk, not where you want it to appear in the survey. To define where in the survey the question should appear, you use the sd_display_question() function with the id set to the same value as the id in the sd_question_reactive() function, like this:\n\nsd_display_question(id = \"brands\")\n\nNow the brands question will be displayed in the survey where you put this code chunk.\nNote that all question responses are automatically saved to the database, but if you wanted to store some other value (e.g. the randomly chosen respondent_id), you could do that with the sd_store_value() function, like this:\n\nsd_store_value(resp_id)"

Many view it as the “next generation” of RMarkdown, though it is more general in that is supports mutliple languages and is not R-specific.\nOne of the most common use cases for me is creating parameterized reports. A parameterized report is one that uses a .qmd file with parameters that can be passed to it while rendering, enabling the ability to create different versions of the output report based on the parameters.\nAs a professor, one way I use parameterized reports is in providing my student’s unique feedback for their assignments. Using parameters like student_name, grade, and feedback, I am able to use a single .qmd file and then render a unique report for each student where those parameters are replaced with the appropriate information for each student.\nRMarkdown and Quarto use almost identical interfaces for rendering parameterized reports, so most of this post applies directly to RMarkdown. But since Quarto is more general and newer, I’m going to focus on Quarto for this post.\nOne more side note—these examples only apply when using knitr as the rendering engine (you can also use parameters with Jupyter, which uses a different syntax)."

This parameter can now be used anywhere in the .qmd file using params$name, which will be replaced with whatever the parameter value is. Note that in a code chunk you can just use params$name directly, but if you want to use it in-line (e.g. in a sentence) you have use an in-line R command, like so:\n\n`r params$name`\n\nYou can include as many parameters as you want, just add them to params. For example, here is how you would add a parameter for name and grade:\n---\nparams:\n  name: \"John\"\n  grade: \"100%\"\n---\nOne nice feature about using parameters is that you an preview the output with the default values, that way you can make sure everything looks the way you want before creating different versions of the document.\nI tend to save these files as something like “template.qmd”, since it is a template that I will use to render to multiple different versions."

    "text": "Passing data frames as parameters\nSince Quarto is a separate program from R, it doesn’t know what a data frame is, so if you pass a data frame object as a parameter in execute_params, it will convert it to a list. This issue was posted in the Posit Community forum here.\nAfter posting about the issue in the Fediverse, both Mickaël Canouil and Garrick Aden-Buie suggested using the {jsonlite} package to serialize the data frame to pass it as a parameter and then un-serialize it back to a data frame inside the .qmd file. Turns out this worked perfectly!\nThe specific functions I use to handle the job are jsonlite::toJSON() and jsonlite::fromJSON(). In the quarto::quarto_render() command, I have to serialize the data frame inside the parameter list like so:\n\nquarto::quarto_render(\n    input = \"template.qmd\",\n    execute_params = list(\n        df = jsonlite::toJSON(df), # Serialize the data frame\n        month = month\n    )\n)\n\nThen inside my “template.qmd” file I un-serialize it back to a data frame inside a code chunk with the following line:\n\ndf &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(params$df)\n\nFrom there on I can use the df object anywhere in my “template.qmd” file as a data frame. The reason this isn’t an issue when using RMarkdown is that RMarkdown runs inside R, so it “knows” what a data frame is throughout the whole process.\nIn the “data-frames” example, I create monthly summary tables of flight departure and arrival delays by airline using the {nycflights} package.\nIn this specific example, an easier approach would be to simply pass the “month” as a parameter to the “template.qmd” file and then compute the summary table there (this is in fact my recommended approach if possible). But that requires that the data be accessible from outside the “template.qmd” file (e.g. saved to disc), and that the summary calculations be relatively fast. If, for example, reading in and summarizing the data is computationally expensive, then it may be easier to do what I have done in this example, which is first read in and summarize all the data, then pass along the summary data frame to the “template.qmd” file as a serialized data frame."

The best solution for now seems to be to simply render the output and then copy it over to a desired output directory.\nIn practice, this is a bit cumbersome as there are a number of different conditions to consider that make the copy-pasting not so simple, so my solution was to write my own custom function that works as a wrapper around quarto::quarto_render() and allows the user to provide an optional output_dir for where the output file will be moved post-rendering.\nI have put this function inside my person R package {jph}, which you can install if you wish to use it yourself. I named the function quarto_render_move(), which renders and then optionally moves the file to a desired location. The function source is available here.\nIn practice, it works as a drop-in replacement for quarto::quarto_render(). Here is an example:\n\njph::quarto_render_move(\n    input = \"template.qmd\",\n    output_file = \"feedback-student.pdf\",\n    output_dir = \"output_folder\",\n    execute_params = list(\n        name = \"Paul\",\n        grade = \"98%\"\n    )\n)\n\nUsing this code, the output file would be placed inside a folder called “output_folder”."

    "title": "Introducing the {renderthis} package",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post introduces the {renderthis}  package (originally named {xaringanBuilder}). The package contains functions for rendering xaringan slides to different formats. Rather than use this post to demo all the package features, I decided to write a brief overview of it’s primary functionality and then focus the rest of this post on the package’s development history. The image above shows the different versions of the package hex sticker, the first one being in the running for the ugliest hex sticker of all time.\n\nWhat can it do?\nThe {renderthis} package contains functions for rendering xaringan slides (Quarto support coming!) to different formats, including html, pdf, png, gif, pptx, and mp4, as well as a ‘social’ output, a png of the first slide re-sized for sharing on social media.\nThe package follows the following render hierarchy:\nRmd\n |\n |--&gt; social (png)\n |\n |--&gt; html\n       |\n       |--&gt; pdf\n             |\n             |--&gt; png\n                   |\n                   |--&gt; gif\n                   |\n                   |--&gt; mp4\n                   |\n                   |--&gt; pptx\nAll of the package functions follow a common pattern:\n\nAll functions start with to_*() to render slides to a desired format (e.g., to_pdf()).\nAll functions have a required from argument which should be set to the full or local path to the input file.\nAll functions have an optional to argument. If provided, it can be a full or local path to the output file, and it must end in an appropriate extension (e.g. slides.gif for to_gif()). If it is not provided, the output file name will be determined based on the from argument.\n\nWhile it is designed for rendering {xaringan} slides, other html slides are also supported. For example, if you have a Quarto presentation rendered as an html file, you can use any of the to_*() functions to render those slides to a pdf, png, gif, pptx, or mp4 file.\nThat’s the gist of what the package does, and the package documentation has many more details about the package features. Now, follow me back to 2020 where this journey began.\n\n\nIn the beginning, there was pagedown::chrome_print()\nThe {renderthis} package began in the fall of 2020 as a solution to a simple problem: converting {xaringan} slides to a pdf. I love {xaringan} slides, but the html format is clunky for sharing, especially as an email attachment, so I wanted a way to convert them to a pdf. Before making the package, my solution was to simply use pagedown::chrome_print() to “print” my rendered html file of {xaringan} slides to a pdf. For the most part, it worked just fine, and it still does! If all you need is a quick pdf of some simple slides, then pagedown::chrome_print() is probably sufficient.\nBut being the lazy programmer I am, I wanted a single function that rendered the html and pdf files from the Rmd source file. So I wrote a quick function I called build_pdf() that was essentially a wrapper around pagedown::chrome_print(). It checked if the input file was an Rmd file, and if so it first rendered the html and then rendered the pdf. It was a pretty simple solution, and I found it easier to remember the function build_pdf() over chrome_print(). With that function written, I decided to name the package {xaringanBuilder} as an homage to Garrick Aden-Buie’s incredible {xaringanExtra} package.\n\n\nBuild all the things!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source\n\nWith build_pdf() working, I realized that I could use the rendered pdf to convert my slides into other format types without too much more effort. For example, I wrote a build_thumbnail() function (a wrapper around pagedown::chrome_print(format = \"png\")) to convert the title slide of the pdf deck to a png image. This was handy for making thumbnail images for youtube recordings of my class lectures (hence the name build_thumbnail()).\nBut then I realized I could also render all the slides to png images, and with the help of the {magick} package I could use magick::image_join() and magick::image_animate() to compile those pngs into an animated gif of my whole presentation! This provided a handy way to share my slides, like posting them on Twitter.\n\n\nEnter stage left: gadenbuie\nJust a couple months after starting the package, Garrick wrote an awesome blog post on using the {chromote} package to print slides to a pdf in a way to allows incremental animations to be rendered on separate slides as well as separate slides for each panel in a panelset (the pagedown::chrome_print() solution would only render these as a single slide).\n\n\n\nJust posted: Do you have complicated {xaringan} #rstats slides or use panelsets from {xaringanExtra}? Do you need a PDF version of your slides? I've got a little function for you:https://t.co/UXwW2KtvOw\n\n— Garrick Aden-Buie (@grrrck) January 25, 2021\n\n\n\nAfter connecting on Twitter, I quickly added Garrick as a contributor and we started working on integrating this function into {xaringanBuilder}.\n\nFolks, at this point I need to tell you about a little-known package development secret: If you want your package to be awesome, ask Garrick to join the project.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough just how much better this package became once Garrick started working on it. Garrick has an excellent eye for making packages user-friendly, and he is an absolute Git / GitHub wizard (read on to the bit about changing the package name to see some of this). Here are a few things he quickly added:\n\nHe made lots of quick changes to make all the functions more robust for different use cases.\nHe integrated the {cli} package to make beautiful status messages so the user can see the progress of the output being built.\nHe introduced the {fs} package to simplify how file paths were being handled (which were getting rather tricky with all the different output types involved).\nHe introduced multiple tests and integrated it with Github Actions so that the tests would run and the {pkgdown} site would render on every commit.\n\nWithout a doubt, Garrick’s additions transformed the package from a handful of convenient functions to a feature-packed, user-friendly tool for rendering slides.\n\n\nOutside influences\nAt this stage, the package had already become quite a useful tool, and many users were filing issues catching little bugs here and there. The package had also grabbed the attention of several people who helped add more features. Bryan Shalloway added the initial support for rendering slides into a powerpoint deck, and Gina Reynolds’s {flipbookr} package provided some inspiration for adding support for rendering slides to mp4 videos.\nMany other people added in small ways to the package over the following year. Some found bugs and posted issues, others sent pull requests with fixes. Over the summer of 2021 Garrick did an overhaul of how paths were handled in the package, after which the package remained relatively stable for about a year.\n\n\nChanging the name\nIn the spring of 2022, Quarto started to catch fire. Alison Hill’s “We don’t talk about Quarto” post (among others) inspired me to check out Quarto presentations, which are quite similar to {xaringan} slides.\n\n\n\nWoah, okay #rstats world I may have to just make the .Rmd -&gt; .qmd switch…@quarto_dev is looking amazing. Exhibit A: Figures and tables in the margins! 🤯 pic.twitter.com/BDEHvxhd6e\n\n— John Paul Helveston (@JohnHelveston) March 30, 2022\n\n\n\nThe revelation of Quarto presentations made me realize that the {xaringanBuilder} package could actually be used to render a wider variety of inputs other than just {xaringan} slides. In fact, I myself had already used it for other purposes, such as converting the first page of a pdf paper I wrote into a png image This prompted me to consider changing the package name.\nAfter a little back and forth, Garrick and I decided to call it {renderthis} as an homage to the phenomenal {usethis} package. We also wanted to maintain the strategy of having every function begin with the same word (previously build_*()), and we chose to_*() so that the package and function names would work together to form a kind of sentence, like renderthis::to_pdf().\nOnce we came up with a new name, implementing that name was daunting. I really had no idea where to begin, so I just created an entirely new repo under jhelvy/renderthis and started editing the source code accordingly. This proved to be a useful exercise as it allowed us to see how the new package would look and feel without touching the older one. In retrospect, I probably should have just opened up a new branch under the {xaringanBuilder} repo to do this, but the nice thing about working from a totally new repo is that I could also preview the documentation with full links, etc. Once we were happy with the way it looked, we actually went back to the {xaringanBuilder} repo and changed the name there.\nThis is where things got a little tricky. Since I already had a repo under jhelvy/renderthis, I couldn’t just change the name of jhelvy/xaringanBuilder to it. So I first changed jhelvy/renderthis to jhelvy/renderthistemp, then changed jhelvy/xaringanBuilder to jhelvy/renderthis. GitHub automagically handles redirects so that any user that navigates to https://github.com/jhelvy/xaringanBuilder gets redirected to https://github.com/jhelvy/renderthis.\nOnce again, shout out to Garrick for using some serious GitHub wizardry here. He was able to salvage most of my edits in the jhelvy/renderthistemp repo and merge them into the new jhelvy/renderthis repo (I still have no idea how he managed this). Garrick guided the way through the messy process of changing a package name without losing any of the commit history on GitHub. With a few more small changes to clean up the package documentation and pkgdown site, {renderthis} was ready to be introduced to the world.\n\n\nGoing to CRAN!\nThe {chromote} and {webshot2} packages (which {renderthis} depends on) were both conveniently released on CRAN in May of 2022. With these additions, we now had every dependency on CRAN, so that gave us the motivation to get {renderthis} on CRAN as well.\nThis too was a bit tricky given what this package does. In particular, the function examples we wrote had code that if executed would error, e.g., renderthis::to_pdf(\"slides.Rmd\"). Even though we wrapped these in \\dontrun{}, CRAN still ran these examples on the first submission. After a little more back and forth on how to address this, Garrick came up with a handy solution by making a new with_example() function which allows the examples to be run in a temp directory, which we use in each function example.\nWith that fix, version 0.1.0 of {renderthis} was published on CRAN 🎉!\n\n\nWhat’s next?\nOne of the complaints I had early on with {xaringan} is that there was no way to print out “handouts”. I can’t stand Powerpoint, but the ability to print out a pdf with small thumbnails of each slide with space for notes was a convenient feature I used often, and to date nothing like it exists for the {xaringan} ecosystem.\nFor this reason, we are working on a to_handout() function that will be introduced in the next version of {renderthis}. Below is an example of a set of demo slides.\n\n\n\nWe’re also planning on supporting rendering Quarto slides, which again was one of the motivations to change the package name to a more general one.\nIf you made it to the end of this post, thanks for reading! And if you give {renderthis} a shot and have feedback or thoughts on it, please let us know by filing an issue.\nAnd if you love the package and just want to let us know about that, drop us a note on the “praise” issue 😊."

    "text": "I recently discovered a wonderfully useful little program called espanso – a “text expander” that I now use on a daily basis. Text expander programs “expand” short text “triggers” into longer / more complex strings of text, like this:\nThere are lots of these programs out there, such as Typinator, or the creatively-named “textexpander” (macOS even has a build-in expander). But I prefer to use open source software whenever possible (the espanso source code is on GitHub), and especially when using software that tracks the text you type (imagine how easy it would be to grab passwords with this type of software). Plus espanso is free 😄. Of course if you’d like to support the project you can donate here.\nMore than anything, I started (and kept) using espanso because I found it to be remarkably simple to use and easy to customize. So far, it has integrated quite nicely into my day-to-day workflow. In fact, I have become such a fan of espanso that I decided to sit down and write a whole post highlighting some of the ways I use it."

    "text": "R\nSince I use R more than any other language, I’ve come up with a lot of R-specific shortcuts. But before I dive into them, a quick side note:\nOne important modification I learned (thanks to some help on the espanso Reddit community) is that if you’re working in RStudio, the expansions don’t quite work correctly on their own (I believe it might have something to do with RStudio’s autofill feature). To fix it, I had to insert the force_clipboard: true setting into each espanso expansion. For example, in my snippet to read in a CSV file, I inserted this option between the trigger and expansion text like this:\n\n  - trigger: \"rrcsv\"\n    force_clipboard: true\n    replace: \"read_csv($|$)\"\n\nOkay with that in mind, I’ll highlight a few R expansions I use a lot. I’ve organized this based on my common workflow for exploring data:\n\nAdd a setup chunk (if working in Rmd)\nLoad libraries & data\nWrangle data\nVisualize\n\n\nAdd a setup chunk\nI usually include a “setup” chunk in most of my Rmd files, but it’s really hard to remember all the specific details for various settings, so I made a dedicated expansion just for this. With this expansion, I can insert my whole default setup chunk with rrsetup:\n  - trigger: \"rrsetup\"\n    force_clipboard: true\n    replace: |\n              ```{r setup, include=FALSE}\n              knitr::opts_chunk$set(\n                warning = FALSE,\n                message = FALSE,\n                fig.path = \"figs/\",\n                fig.width = 7.252,\n                fig.height = 4,\n                comment = \"#&gt;\",\n                fig.retina = 3\n              )\n              ```\n\n\nLoad libraries & data\n\n\n\nI use some simple shortcuts to load individual libraries, like rrtidy to expand to library(tidyverse). But (as shown in the above image) I also set up an expansion to load some of my most often used libraries and settings. By typing rrstart, I get this expansion:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cowplot)\noptions(dplyr.width = Inf)\n\nWith my libraries loaded, I then read in my data. I use rrcsv to expand to read_csv($|$), rrex to expand to read_excel($|$), and rrhere to expand to here::here($|$), which I use to define paths to files.\n\nSide note: if you don’t already, you should definitely try using the {here} package to define paths.\n\n\n\nWrangle data\n\n\n\nI usually wrangle my data using tidyverse commands, and I have come up with a few expansions for some common “pipelines”. For example, one common sequence is to do grouped summary operations. I use the rrgs (“gs” for “grouped summary”) trigger to load the code block:\n\n    group_by() %&gt;%\n    summarise()\n\nLikewise, I use the rrgm trigger to load the code block for a grouped mutate:\n\n    group_by() %&gt;%\n    mutate()\n\nThere are so many of these you could put together!\n\n\nVisualize\n\n\n\nSince {ggplot2} has such a distinct syntax, I decided to start my ggplot code snippets with gg rather than rr. Some of my favoriate {ggplot2} expansions are the scaling shortcuts:\n\nggsxc –&gt; scale_x_continuous()\nggsyc –&gt; scale_y_continuous()\nggsxd –&gt; scale_x_discrete()\nggsyd –&gt; scale_y_discrete()\n\nI also use some snippets for common geoms, like ggpoint:\n\nggplot() +\n    geom_point(aes(x = , y = ))\n\nand ggcol:\n\nggplot() +\n    geom_col(aes(x = , y = , fill = ))"

    "text": "My research focuses on understanding the factors influencing the development and adoption of emerging low-carbon technologies, particularly electric vehicles and solar PV panels.\nInternationally, I have highlighted China’s crucial role as the leading global supplier of these technologies, as detailed in our 2019 publication in Science. In a subsequent paper published in 2022 in Nature, we used two-factor engineering learning curve models to quantify billions of dollars in cost savings from rapid cost declines associated with high learning rates from a globalized solar PV supply chain, which is the reason solar is now the cheapest source of electricity in most parts of the world. This issue is central to informing ongoing international trade disputes and addressing climate change.\nI have also extensively studied the EV industry, both in China and the U.S. In a paper published in Research Policy, I analyzed how China’s national and local institutions have interacted with industrial policy to foster a highly competitive environment for EV innovation, leading to the success of indigenous companies like BYD and Geely. In the U.S., my students and I leveraged tens of millions of online vehicle listings scraped from the web to quantify significant EV market trends, such as how EVs are being used and how they are depreciating. I have also studied factors that affect people’s willingness to buy an EV. In a paper published in Environmental Research Letters, we found that direct experiences with EVs positively impact purchase intentions. In a subsequent paper, we found that U.S. vehicle buyers overwhelmingly prefer immediate rebates at the point of sale, with this preference being particularly strong among lower-income households and used vehicle buyers. Our study was referenced by the White House and the U.S. Department of Treasury as justification to support restructuring EV incentives to be applied at the point of sale, which was implemented in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nView my full CV here\n Google Scholar ORCID Research Gate\n\nUnderline indicates advisee; * graduate student, **undergraduate student\n\n\n\n\n    Jenn, A., Chakraborty, A., Hardman, S., Hoogland, K., Sugihara, C., Tal, G., Helveston, J.P., Rich, J., Jochem, P., Sprei, F., Williams, B, Axsen, J., Figenbaum, E., Plötz, P., Pontes, J., Refa, N.

It is designed for students interested in developing problem-solving skills, business acumen, and–most notably–an entrepreneurial mindset. The course emphasizes how individuals identify opportunities, develop business models, and create ventures that address challenges in agriculture and food systems.\n\n\nSemesters Taught:\n\nFall 2025\nFall 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nAREC 310: Food and Agricultural Markets\n\n\nThe primary objective is to foster development and understanding of key agricultural marketing issues and concerns, equip you with analytical skills that may be utilized to evaluate different marketing problems and programs from both the industry and firm perspective. This course will provide you with an understanding of economic concepts that will be employed for analyzing issues in agricultural marketing\n\n\nSemesters Taught:\n\nFall 2025\nFall 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nAREC 330: Data-Driven Decision Making n Agricultural and Resource Economics\n\n\nThe world generates 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day. One of the key modern business challenges is transforming that data into actionable insights that improve decision making (i.e., data-driven decision making). Transforming data into information is not magic. It requires understanding the decision problem, organizing and processing data, analyzing data, and finally presenting information. This course will introduce you to this process of transforming data into actionable insights and build a core set of competencies with two commonly used software: R and Tableau. Since we only have 16 weeks, the most important lesson you will learn in this class is how to teach yourself what you need to know in the future. You will learn these skills by completing the three group projects over the semester.\n\n\nSemesters Taught:\n\nSpring 2025\nSpring 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nAREC 570: Methodology of Economic Research\n\n\nPhilosophical foundations of science and research.

    "text": "One of the things I love about {distill} as a site builder is that it is super light weight. It comes out of the box with very few bells and whistles, enabling you to create a site from scratch in minutes. I tried using {blogdown} with the Hugo Academic theme, but in the end I found the overall configuration a bit overwhelming, even with the guidance of Alison Hill’s incredible post on how to do it (btw, if you want to make a blogdown site, you totally should read her posts on blogdown). Distill was just simpler, so I dove in.\nThat said, once I did get my distill site running, I found myself longing for some of the really cool features I’ve seen on peoples’ blogdown sites, like Alison Hill’s site (if you can’t tell, Alison’s work has been a major source of inspiration for me). But then I realized, “wait a minute…I’m working in R, and whenever I want some functionality that doesn’t yet exist, I can just write my own functions!”\nSo that’s what I set out to do - write a bunch of functions and hack away at CSS to construct the features I wanted. This post walks through my general strategy and then shows how I implemented some of the features on my site."

    "title": "In search of keyboard nirvana",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When I entered grad school, I started spending far more time typing on a computer than I had before. After a few months in, I started searching for a better typing experience and ways to reduce the amount of keystrokes needed to get the job done. Now a decade later, I have most definitely taken the red pill and become far more aware of solutions and technologies I never would have imagined back then. This post is a brief summary of my journey in search of keyboard nirvana.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe back in 2011 reading about mechanical keyboards.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical keyboards\nOne of my first roommates in graduate school was a remarkably fast typist and used this loud, clacky mechanical keyboard (I had to wear earplugs or listen to music to get anything done when he was typing). Curiosity got the best of me, and after trying out his keyboard for a few minutes I immediately understood why people use mechanical keyboards. There is something about the combination of aural and tactile feedback you get when typing on a keyboard with mechanical switches that makes the typing experience just…better. But it wasn’t just aesthetically better - I was able to type at a faster speed and with fewer errors when using a mechanical keyboard.\nNeedless to say, I immediately started searching for a mechanical keyboard to replace my crummy old Apple keyboard. Somewhere along my searching, I came across articles about people who “re-mapped” their keyboards so that some key presses would trigger other events. This seemed like a powerful idea for reducing key strokes, and after a bit more searching I discovered Karabiner Elements for mac. This software is invaluable. I made loads of customizations to simplify common operations. I became so dependent on it that I decided to design a custom key cap set for my first mechanical keyboard from WASD Keyboards to match my Karabiner Elements settings\n\n\n\n\n\nA rendering of my first custom mechanical keyboard, from WASD Keyboards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemapping your keyboard\nThere are many software options for customizing and re-mapping your keyboard. I use Karabiner Elements for mac, but AutoHotkey is probably the most popular option for Windows users.\nThe use cases for these programs are endless, but I want to highlight one very powerful idea: adding keyboard layers. Every keyboard has at least two layers: the normal layer, and the “shift” layer that converts lower-case letters to upper-case and numbers to symbols. Unfortunately, some of the most useful keys (e.g. navigation arrows) are not conveniently located and require you to move your hand every time you want to use them. So one of the first things I implemented in re-mapping my keyboard was to try and move those navigation arrows back to “home row”:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere I wanted to relocate the navigation arrows.\n\n\n\n\nMy solution was to introduce a “Capslock” layer. This layer works just like the shift layer, except it gets triggered when holding down the otherwise rarely-used Capslock key. This layer uses J / I / K / L as arrow keys for navigating the cursor selecting text, and it re-maps the S / D / F keys into cut, copy, and paste as well as N and H into backspace and delete:\n\n\n\n\n\nMy capslock layer.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the demo below, this modification enables me to navigate the cursor and edit code / text without ever having to leave home row:\n\n\n\n\nYour browser does not support HTML video. \n\nI use Karabiner Elements for lots of other things too, like:\n\nLaunching applications like Google Chrome or Terminal with a single hotkey.\nOpening Google Chrome to a webpage (e.g. gmail) with a single hotkey.\nTyping my email send off (\"Cheers,\\nJP\") with a single hotkey.\n\nYou can see all of my Karabiner Elements settings here.\n\n\nTowards better ergonomics with split keyboards\nTypical keyboard layouts are not that ergonomic, and after several years of using my WASD keyboard I eventually started developing wrist pain. My specific pain was from prolonged ulnar deviation, where the hands are bent outward at the wrist joint. So I started searching for a split keyboard to be able to hold my hands at a more natural position while typing (split keyboards actually fix a lot of ergonomic problems).\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit keyboards fix a lot of ergonomic problems, like ulnar deviation.\n\n\n\n\nAfter doing a lot of research on different split boards, I decided to try out the Ergodox EZ, a highly-rated (albeit quite expensive) keyboard. I chose the Ergodox EZ as it had a 30-day return policy (though you have to pay the return shipping), and because the company that makes the Ergodox (ZSA) has some of the most highly-rated customer service of any company ever. I figured if I didn’t like it, I could probably return it without too much hassle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ergodox EZ.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the other features that attracted me to the Ergodox is their Oryx configurator software. This is an in-browser web application that enables you to fully customize every single key on the keyboard through a very user-friendly UI. All of a sudden, many of the key features that I loved about Karabiner Elements (such as re-mapping my Capslock key to use navigation arrows on the home row) could be programmed directly into the keyboard itself. This meant I could use the keyboard on any computer and have the same re-mapped keys at the ready.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Oryx software.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of things to like about the Ergodox. First, the Oryx software was a game changer. Being able to directly control what each key does gave me all sorts of new ideas that made my typing incredibly efficient and far more comfortable than anything I had used in the past. But the single biggest improvement was probably the thumb key cluster. Your thumbs are quite strong, but on most keyboards they’re only useful for the space bar and maybe some contorted use of modifier keys. In contrast, the Ergodox has several keys right under each thumb, enabling far more efficient and comfortable access to using your thumb to type.\nMy single biggest improvement in using the thumb keys was to swap what used to be my capslock layer trigger to a thumb key. Now instead of holding down the capslock key with my much weaker left pinky finger to trigger a new layer, I could use my much stronger left thumb, freeing up my left pinky finger to actually type key strokes.\nAll together, the Ergodox EZ was a major improvement in my typing, both in terms of ergonomics and efficiency. My typing speed also increased from ~70 on an Apple keyboard to ~90 on the Ergodox. But after about six months of use, I still found some things weren’t quite right with the board. This review is a great summary of the pros and cons of the Ergodox, but my single biggest complaint was the precise location of the thumb key clusters. Most thumb keys were just too far away to be useful, and even the main thumb keys were a little too far out for my hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe after about 6 months of using the Ergodox EZ thumb cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding my own split keyboard\nIf you’re at the point where you’re typing on an Ergodox EZ, it doesn’t take long before you start realizing there’s an entire world out there of DIY keyboard hobbists obsessed with ergonomics and custom built keyboards. A short perusal of r/ErgoMechKeyboards and you’ll see a wide range of bizarre keyboards you never would have imagined existed, with names like Iris, Lily58, Kyria, and Corne.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe after first discovering r/ErgoMechKeyboards.\n\n\n\n\nAs an engineering faculty member at George Washington University, many of the tools needed to dive into building my own keyboard (e.g. a soldering iron) were readily available to me via the makers space in the GW Innovation Center. So I convinced myself that making a keyboard would be a fun excuse to learn some new skills and meet more of the engineering students at GW (this was in 2018, only a few months after I had started at GW). I decided to make a Lily58, mostly because the parts were quite cheap and available at keyhive.xyz.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my first ever DIY keyboard (a Lily58), assembled (mostly) in the GW Innovation Center.\n\n\n\n\nThe project of building a Lily58 was a great learning experience, and I am more greatful for the people I met in the GWIC than in what I learned about building keyboards. Turns out building a keyboard covers quite a lot of engineering skills, including:\n\nSoldering microelectronics and circuitry.\nCAD design for making case components.\n3D printing and laser cutting those case components.\nProgramming the keyboard firmware.\n\nI got to work with some talented GW undergraduates on Friday afternoons working on each of these tasks. Someone even got this very promotional-esque shot of me working with a student soldering some microelectronics:\n\n\n\n\n\nA very staged-looking (but actually wasn’t staged) photo of me working with a student in the GWIC.\n\n\n\n\nI have to say that working with student in the GWIC has been a real highlight of my little keyboard journey. Given that most of what I do and teach as a professor involves the virtual space of data analysis and programming, it was great to get to do some “hands on” engineering tasks with students outside of the classroom.\n\n\nTowards an “End Game”\nIn the world of DIY keyboards, many speak of a mythical “End Game” keyboard - one that is so perfected that you hang up your soldering iron, never to build another keyboard again. Of course, in reality each keyboard project is a step in another direction that almost inevitably leads to yet another keyboard project. It’s a similar logic to biking rule #12:\n\n\n\n\n\n…where N is the current number of bikes owned.\n\n\n\n\nIn my case, I have now built no less than four keyboards, so I believe I can officially call building custom keyboards a hobby (problem?).\n\n\n\n\n\nMost peoples’ reaction after I show them my keyboards.\n\n\n\n\nFor each new keyboard project, I either found something new I wanted to try out, or I found something I didn’t quite like about the last project (or both). For my Lily58, the biggest issue was simply the build quality wasn’t that high. I used sockets to hold the key switches in place so I could swap out different switches, but whenever I traveled with the board many of the switches would fall out, which got annoying pretty fast.\nSo I decided to build an Iris keyboard – a close cousin to the Lily58 in terms of the key layout. I also decided to keep a detailed record of my build process as I learned so many tiny details in the process that I figured could help others looking to build their own keyboards (e.g. installing a rotary encoder).\n\n\n\n\n\nMy second keyboard - an Iris Rev 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nA rotary what now?\n\nOn most of my DIY boards, I have a rotary encoder on the right hand side, which is like a rotational switch. I use them for a variety of things. Perhaps the most obvious might be as a volume knob, but I also have my keyboards configured such that the rotary encoder triggers different behaviors depending on the active layer, including volume control, scrolling up and down, scrolling left and right, and zooming in and out.\n\n\n\n\n\nA rotary encoder I mounted on my Iris keyboard.\n\n\n\n\nMy Iris was a fantastic keyboard. Again, I worked a lot on it in the GWIC, using the 3D printers to print the case and soldering equipment to assemble much of the components. After some heavy use though, the rotary encoder broke off, and it was essentially irreparable, so I decided to build what seemed like a more robust keyboard – the Kyria.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy third keyboard - a Kyria Rev 1.\n\n\n\n\nDesigned by Thomas Baart, the Kyria keyboard has arguably the best assembly documentation of any keyboard kit I’ve seen, and as such it is usually the board I recommend to first-time builders. Thomas put a lot of thought into the design of the board, and in general I would say this is probably the best quality board I have built (more photos here, and details about the board here). I also learned a bit more about using CAD with this keyboard as I modified the 3D printed case using Fusion 360 (thanks again to GW’s institutional license!). That said, the layout of this board just isn’t quite as comfortable for my hands as the Iris layout. In particular, the column stagger is much more aggressive, and it just doesn’t quite work for my hands.\nSo that leads me to my latest (and hopefully last?) build: a Wireless Corne (more photos here). The Corne keyboard has a near identical layout with the Iris, minus the number row. By this point, I had moved to using as many as five different keyboard layers, one of which being a numpad on my right hand, so I no longer used the number row anyway. Going wireless was also a very attractive option as I enjoy working in coffee shops and libraries on my laptop, so traveling with a compact and wireless keyboard would be much more convenient. As with my Iris, I kept a detailed build log.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy (final?) keyboard - a Wireless Corne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirmware\nI would be remiss if I didn’t at least mention the incredible open source software that runs all of these DIY keyboards. The main software most people use to power their keyboards is QMK Firmware. The software has become so developed that there’s even an open source keyboard configurator, similar to the Oryx software for the Ergodox. QMK is packed with loads of features, but perhaps most importantly is the highly flexible layer configurations, enabling you to map multiple layers so that your hands rarely ever need to leave the home row position.\nQMK’s wireless cousin is ZMK Firmware, which I am running on my wireless Corne. ZMK is newer and shares many of the same features as QMK, though not quite as many. It is also designed quite differently, and I would say it has a slightly steeper learning curve compared to QMK. If you’re newer to building your own keyboard, using QMK with the GUI configurator.\n\n\nTrade offs in going split\nThere are several drawbacks to adopting a split keyboard, but I want to discuss two common ones:\n\nCost\nLearning curve\n\n\nCost\nPerhaps one of the biggest drawbacks of split keyboards is that they generally cost more than traditional keyboards. Nonetheless, there are lots of good options for under or around $100 USD, such as:\n\nMicrosoft Scult ($60)\nKINESIS Freestyle ($99.00)\nLogitech ERGO K860 ($125.00)\n\nSome of the more premium split boards can cost quite a lot more, such as the Ergodox EZ at ~$350. And even building your own split keyboard isn’t all that cheap, with the final cost usually ranging from ~$100 to $250 depending on the parts used.\nBut despite the sometimes higher cost, I encourage you to re-frame your thinking about the value you get from your keyboards.\nFirst, if you use your keyboard on a daily basis for your job, you should consider your keyboard as a professional instrument. Professional musicians invest thousands of dollars into their instruments, and likewise professional chefs invest thousands of dollars into their knives. So if you type for a profession, why not spend only a few hundred dollars on a professional keyboard?\nSecond, consider your keyboard as a medical device. Billions of people depend on glasses to see well, and a typical pair of glasses can easily cost several hundred dollars. And just as using a correctly-prescribed pair of glasses is important for the health of your eyes, using a more ergonomic keyboard is important for the health of your fingers, hands, wrists, and shoulders (yes, all of those things are affected by how you type).\nSo yes, purchasing an ergonomic keyboard may cost you a little more up front, but it is generally an investment worth making, and especially if you are already finding yourself in pain from typing.\n\n\nLearning curve\nAdopting any new technology generally comes with a learning curve, and moving to a split keyboard is no different. But how hard it is to adapt to a new keyboard varies by a variety of factors.\nFirst, if you already are proficient at touch-typing (meaning you use all 10 fingers to type and you don’t need to look down at the key legends), adopting a split keyboard probably won’t be too challenging. For me, I found I was a little slower and made more errors for a few days when first using a split board, but after about a week I was back to otherwise “normal” typing speed. If you are not a proficient touch typist, I recommend getting up to a good typing speed (~60 WPM) before adopting a split keyboard. This is because split boards essentially force you to use the appropriate hand for each key, so if you are also learning how to type while using the split keyboard, you may find it extra challenging.\nSecond, the type of split keyboard can matter quite a lot. Some boards, such as the Microsoft Sculpt, have two split halves but are otherwise quite similar in the key positions compared to typical keyboards. Others, such as the Ergodox EZ, use an “ortholinear” layout, meaning that each row of keys align into columns with no stagger across rows. These columnar layouts are arguably more ergonomic and comfortable to type on, but they can take a little longer to get used to.\nMy recommendation is to try out a split board of some type and practice using it on a site like keybr.com. Get used to it first and give it at least a week of regular use before judging it. It can take a week or more for it to stop feeling strange, and your hands will thank you in the long run.\n\n\n\nAlternative layouts?\nThe one thing I tried along this journey that I generally do not recommend is learning a new keyboard layout, such as Colemak or Dvorak.\nIn case you didn’t know, the typical QWERTY layout is actually a pretty poor layout in terms of typing efficiency and ergonomics. There are lots of stories about why this layout was originally chosen. Some say it was intentionally designed to be inefficient so that early typewriter arms wouldn’t jam up if someone got to typing too fast. My favorite story is that early typewriter salesmen didn’t know how to type, but the QWERTY layout enabled them to type “typewriter” by using only the upper row, making it easier to remember the sequence.\nWhatever the reason for designing the layout, QWERTY is pretty bad, but we’re all unfortunately pretty much stuck with it as the defacto standard. Being the keyboard enthusiast that I am, I have attempted several times to adopt Colemak, but I have never been able to get my speed anywhere near my speed with QWERTY. But I also do not see much benefit to using a different layout, especially relative to the steep learning curve in mastering it. I do not feel any discomfort using QWERTY, and my typing speed on a split keyboard is ~90 words per minute, which is plenty fast enough to be an efficient typist. So, this is just to say that if you came across this post looking for tips on ergonomic typing, I would much more heavily weigh using a split keyboard over the particular key layout on that keyboard. That said, if you’re not that proficient yet at any layout, you might save yourself some trouble and just start with an alternative to QWERTY.\n\n\nTools to build your own keyboard\nAt this point in my keyboard journey, I’m starting to wonder how different my life might be today if I had taken the blue pill. Certainly my hands and shoulders would be in much worse shape, but I might also just be happy using a simple old Apple keyboard. Ignorance can sometimes be bliss.\n\n\n\n\n\nMe in 2021 with about three too many keyboards in my office.\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, should you choose to go down this path, hopefully I can save you a bit of time with some suggested tools. First, you’ll need some pretty standard equipment. Here are my recommendations:\n\nA cheap soldering iron is all you really need to get the job done. No need to spend a fortune, especially if you won’t use it too often.\nA brass sponge to clean the soldering iron tip is a must. A good brass sponge will make up for anything lacking in a cheap iron.\nA cheap solder fan is a good idea, especially if you’re working in small spaces. Solder fumes are pretty toxic, and these little things actually work very well.\nReverse tweezers are a lifesaver for holding tiny parts.\nA Silicon mat is really nice so you don’t burn your desk and lose tiny parts.\nNot super necessary, but some sort of quad hand tool can be helpful for holding everything still when working.\n\nIn terms of suppliers, most keyboard parts shops are regional. In the U.S., both Keyhive and Littlekeyboards have a lot to offer.\nIf you want to learn more about and / or compare the many different split keyboards out there, check out this Shiny App I made (source code here). I made it both to help the community of split keyboard users find their next board, but also to learn and practice a lot about building Shiny Apps.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of my splitKbCompare app.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, if you do choose to adopt any of the solutions I wrote about in this post, please do reach out (Twitter, Reddit) - I’m happy to help however I can!\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose wisely."

    "title": "Simulating the Squid Game bridge scene in R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "If you had a Netflix account in 2021, chances are you’ve at least heard of Squid Game – a South Korean survival drama in which players play a series of children’s games for the chance to win a large sum of money, with the penalty of death if they lose. The show is like a mixture of Richard Connell’s The Most Dangerous Game, the Hunger Games, and the horror stories of Edgar Allan Poe. It quickly became the #1 most most-watched show after just one week of being released.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: I mention a few details in this post that might be spoilers if you haven’t yet watched the show.\n\nIn Episode 7, the remaining 16 players play a game where they must cross a glass bridge with 18 steps. At each step, the lead player must choose between two glass panes – one made of tempered glass strong enough to support two players, and the other of regular glass that will shatter if stepped on, in which case the player will plummet to their death. You can watch the scene here.\nWhen I watched the episode, I immediately started trying to calculate the expected number of survivors for the game. While seemingly straightforward, the problems is a bit more complex when you realize that each person behind the leader learns information from the leader’s choices. That is, if the lead player chooses the “not safe” pane, that player dies, but every remaining player now knows which glass pane is “safe” at that step.\nRather than try and work the math, I decided to take a Monte Carlo approach – just simulate a bunch of trials of the game, then count up how many players “survived” in each trial.\n\nDefining the simulation\nThe first step I took in trying to simulate the game is to simplify the problem. The actual game has two glass panes (one “safe” and one “not safe”) at each step in the bridge. This same situation can be modeled with a series of single steps where the lead player has a 50% chance of surviving at each step. If the lead player steps on a “not safe” pane, we mark that player as dead and replace that pane with a “safe” one, allowing all remaining players to safely cross it.\nTo run a simulation, I first had to create the players, which I modeled using a simple data.table of 1s and 0s for “alive” and “dead”. Everyone starts out alive.\n\n# Create an initial data.table of players\nlibrary(data.table)\n\nnum_players &lt;- 16\nplayers &lt;- data.table(player = seq(num_players), alive = 1)\nplayers\n\n#&gt;     player alive\n#&gt;  1:      1     1\n#&gt;  2:      2     1\n#&gt;  3:      3     1\n#&gt;  4:      4     1\n#&gt;  5:      5     1\n#&gt;  6:      6     1\n#&gt;  7:      7     1\n#&gt;  8:      8     1\n#&gt;  9:      9     1\n#&gt; 10:     10     1\n#&gt; 11:     11     1\n#&gt; 12:     12     1\n#&gt; 13:     13     1\n#&gt; 14:     14     1\n#&gt; 15:     15     1\n#&gt; 16:     16     1\n\n\nTo simulate a single game, I created a run_game() function that iterates through a specified number of bridge steps, each with a 50% chance of being “safe”. The function iterates through each step until all “safe” panels are known, at which point the remaining “alive” players are assumed to all be able to safely finish crossing the bridge (I am assuming that all players have sufficient time to cross the bridge).\n\n# Define a function for simulating one game\nrun_game &lt;- function(players, num_steps) {\n    lead_player &lt;- 1\n    for (step in seq(num_steps)) {\n        # 50% chance that the pane is safe\n        if (sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 1)) {\n            # The pane is safe, keep going!\n            next\n        } else {\n            # The pane broke 💀\n            # Before continuing, check if any players are still alive\n            if (sum(players$alive) == 0) { return(players$alive) }\n            # The lead player died\n            players$alive[lead_player] &lt;- 0\n            lead_player &lt;- lead_player + 1\n        }\n    }\n    return(players$alive)\n}\n\nWith that, let’s run one game of 18 steps and 16 players (same as in the show):\n\n# Run one iteration of the game\nsingle_game &lt;- run_game(players, num_steps = 18)\nsingle_game\n\n#&gt;  [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\n\nSo after one game, we had 4 survivors. But of course if we want to get an estimate of the expected number of survivors, we need to run lots of trials of the game (a lot of bits are about to die).\n\n\nEstimating the expected number of survivors\nI ran my trials inside a data.table, a simulation strategy I picked up from Grant McDermott and his wonderful post on efficient simulations in R.\n\n# Run the main trials\n\n# Repeat the \"players\" data.table for each trial\nnum_trials &lt;- 10000\nsims &lt;- players[rep(seq(num_players), num_trials),]\n\n# Keep track of the trial number\nsims[, trial := rep(seq(num_trials), each = num_players)]\n\n# Now run the simulation for each trial\nsims[, alive := run_game(.SD, num_steps = 18), by = trial]\n\nIn addition to being very fast, one really nice thing about running the trials using {data.table} is that you get all of the results back in a nicely-formatted data.table, which you can then use to compute all sorts of statistics.\nFor example, if you wanted to see the outcome of an individual trial, just filter for it:\n\n# View one trial outcome\nsims[trial == 42]\n\n#&gt;     player alive trial\n#&gt;  1:      1     0    42\n#&gt;  2:      2     0    42\n#&gt;  3:      3     0    42\n#&gt;  4:      4     0    42\n#&gt;  5:      5     0    42\n#&gt;  6:      6     0    42\n#&gt;  7:      7     0    42\n#&gt;  8:      8     0    42\n#&gt;  9:      9     0    42\n#&gt; 10:     10     1    42\n#&gt; 11:     11     1    42\n#&gt; 12:     12     1    42\n#&gt; 13:     13     1    42\n#&gt; 14:     14     1    42\n#&gt; 15:     15     1    42\n#&gt; 16:     16     1    42\n\n\nOf course, we can also use the trials to compute the expected number of survivors from the game. Since the outcomes are discrete, I take median number of survivors across all trials to reflect the expected number of survivors:\n\n# Compute the expected number of survivors across all trials\ntrials_counts &lt;- sims[, .(count = sum(alive)), by = trial]\nexpected_survivors &lt;- median(trials_counts$count)\nexpected_survivors\n\n#&gt; [1] 7\n\n\nThe simulation suggests that we should expect 7 players to survive when running a game with 16 players and 18 steps. When we look at the distribution of trial outcomes, we can also see that there is a pretty good chance of having 6 or 8 survivors in any one round of the game:\n\n# Plot the distribution of survivors across all trials\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ntrial_count_summary &lt;- as.data.frame(table(trials_counts$count))\nnames(trial_count_summary) &lt;- c(\"n_survivors\", \"count\")\n\nggplot(trial_count_summary) +\n  geom_col(aes(x = n_survivors, y = count), width = 0.1) + \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Outcomes of 10,000 trials\",\n    x = \"Number of survivors\", \n    y = \"Count\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose wisely\nWhile the expected number of survivors from these trials is higher than the actual number in the TV series (only 3 survive), keep in mind that these trials reflect ideal conditions in which all the players act strictly rationally. In the show, multiple players die as a result of the selfish or revengeful actions of other players, not strictly because of the breaking glass panes.\nBut perhaps the more important question from the perspective of the players is:\n\n“Which number should I choose?”\n\nObviously choosing a larger number closer to the back of the line gives the player a higher probability of survival because the players in front identify all the “safe” glass panes. But how likely would you be to survive if you chose a number near the middle (which most players in the TV series chose first)?\nSince we have all the results of every trial outcome for every player in a convenient data.table, computing the probability of surviving for each player is straightforward:\n\n# Plot the probability of survival based on the player order number\nsurvival_summary &lt;- sims[, .(p_survive = sum(alive) / num_trials), by = player]\n\nggplot(survival_summary) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = player, y = p_survive)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(16)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Probability of survival based on player order number\",\n    x = \"Player order number\", \n    y = \"Probability\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo even though the expected number of survivors is 7 out of 16 players, those survivors are overwhelmingly more likely to be the players who chose the highest order numbers.\n\n\nHow many steps to include?\nOne final question I had was what if the game designers chose to include more steps in the bridge? Because this was not supposed to be the last game, the designers needed to make sure at least two players survived, otherwise the games would simply end.\nWe can see from the previous simulations that with 16 players, the choice of 18 steps already puts a small (but non-zero) probability on having less than two survivors:\n\n# Probability of having less than two survivors\nsum(trials_counts$count &lt; 2) / num_trials\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.0036\n\n\nOf course this is probably an under-estimate of the true probability of having less than two survivors because the players are human beings who tend to make irrational choices when playing a deadly game (as we saw play out in the TV series version of the game).\nStill, what if the game designers were more risk seeking? How many steps could they include if they were willing to live with, for example, a 5% chance of having less than 2 players remaining at the end of the bridge game?\nTo answer that, we have to re-run our simulations, but with an increasing number of steps. To keep things simple, I run 1,000 iterations of the game over an increasing number of steps from 10 to 30:\n\n# Re-run the trials using an increasing number of bridge steps (10 to 30)\n\n# Repeat the \"players\" data.table for each trial\nmin_num_steps &lt;- 10\nmax_num_steps &lt;- 30\nstep_trials &lt;- seq(min_num_steps, max_num_steps, by = 1)\nnum_step_trials &lt;- length(step_trials)\nnum_trials &lt;- 1000\nstep_sims &lt;- players[rep(seq(num_players), num_trials*num_step_trials),]\n\n# Keep track of the trial number and the step number\nstep_sims[, trial := rep(seq(num_trials*num_step_trials), each = num_players)]\nstep_sims[, steps := rep(step_trials, each = num_players*num_trials)]\n\n# Now run the simulation for each trial\nstep_sims[, alive := run_game(.SD, num_steps = unique(steps)), by = trial]\n\nNow I can compute the probability of having less than two survivors for each step size:\n\n# Compute probability of having less than two survivors for each step size\nstep_counts &lt;- step_sims[, .(count = sum(alive)), by = c(\"trial\", \"steps\")]\nstep_summary &lt;- step_counts[, .(p_under2 = sum(count &lt; 2) / num_trials), by = steps]\n\nggplot(step_summary) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = steps, y = p_under2)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = step_trials) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Probability of having less than two remaining players\",\n    x = \"Number of bridge steps\", \n    y = \"Probability\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI found it interesting that 18 steps seems to be the point at which the probability of having less than two remaining players begins to increase from essentially 0. With just a few more steps, the probability rapidly increases:\n\nstep_summary[steps %in% seq(18, 23)]\n\n#&gt;    steps p_under2\n#&gt; 1:    18    0.005\n#&gt; 2:    19    0.008\n#&gt; 3:    20    0.024\n#&gt; 4:    21    0.040\n#&gt; 5:    22    0.057\n#&gt; 6:    23    0.107\n\n\nOkay, that’s it! I’m sure I probably made an error somewhere - let me know if you find one, and hopefully this was an interesting example of how to conduct some relatively efficient Monte Carlo simulations in R with the help of the {data.table} package.\n\n\nUpdate 1 - including time\nUpdated October 22, 2021\nMany people on twitter and reddit had some great suggestions about this post. In particular, @evalparse had a brilliant, one-line solution for simulating the number of survivors in one game:\n\n\n\nOne critique that was mentioned multiple times was that my simulations left out a critical element in the game: time. In the show, the players had just 16 minutes to cross the bridge, otherwise all of the glass panes shatter and anyone left behind dies. I originally omitted time for simplicity, but looking back at it now this is a pretty crucial element in the game because it means that the latter order numbers aren’t necessarily so safe after all – the further back in line you are, the higher risk you face of running out of time.\nSo, here’s one attempt at including time in the simulation.\nMy immediate thought was to assume a distribution for the amount of time delay it takes for a player to take a step and then sample from that distribution for each player in each trial of the game. The key question is what should that distribution look like?\nObviously time needs to be positive, so I can’t use distributions that could have negative numbers. But time also can’t go on forever – as we saw in the show, the people in the back of the line start to get impatient if the lead player takes too long and might “encourage” them to make a choice.\nSince I didn’t have any real-world data to inform my decision (I sure hope there are no real-world data on this!), I decided to use the data from the show itself. I re-watched the scene and timed how long each lead player took to take a step. Time in the show isn’t quite preserved because the camera cuts to other scenes, there’s slow motion, etc., but many of the steps could be timed, so here’s what I measured:\n\n# Lead player step times in seconds\nseconds &lt;- c(36, 20, 25, 49, 66, 22, 112, 10, 115, 184, 144, 18, 22, 36, 28, 15, 10)\nsummary(seconds)\n\n#&gt;    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n#&gt;   10.00   20.00   28.00   53.65   66.00  184.00\n\n\nMost lead players moved relatively quickly, with a median of just 28 seconds. But a few players took longer. In the show, player 9 (the bully guy) took quite a long time, and he might have taken longer if he wasn’t forced to move by the woman he scorned.\nGiven these considerations, I chose to model the step time with a log-normal distribution because it prevents negative times and it has a long tail for those one or two players who might take a long time to move. Here are the parameters that fit these data, using the lovely fitdistr() function from the {MASS} package:\n\nfit &lt;- MASS::fitdistr(seconds, \"log-normal\")\nfit\n\n#&gt;     meanlog      sdlog  \n#&gt;   3.5781872   0.8824273 \n#&gt;  (0.2140201) (0.1513350)\n\n\nLet’s take a quick visual check of the fit:\n\nmeanlog &lt;- fit$estimate[1]\nsdlog &lt;- fit$estimate[2]\nggplot() + \n    geom_histogram(aes(x = seconds, y = ..density..), \n                   binwidth = 10, fill = \"grey60\") +\n    geom_density(aes(x = rlnorm(1000, meanlog, sdlog)), color = \"red\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 200)) +\n    theme_bw() + \n    labs(\n        title = \"Log-normal fit of time delay for each lead player step\",\n        x = \"Time (seconds)\",\n        y = \"Density\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it a good fit? Eh, sort of?\nDo I have time to do a better job? Not really.\nOne issue with the log-normal though is that you can occasionally get a really high number out on that long tail, which I would think is highly unlikely because at some point the next player is just going to push you off the bridge. So I censored my log-normal fit at 200 seconds. So, with this in mind, I created a new run_game_timed() function that includes a time delay for each step, sampling from a censored log-normal distribution.\n\n# Modified function for simulating one game with time\nrun_game_timed &lt;- function(players, num_steps, max_seconds, meanlog, sdlog) {\n    lead_player &lt;- 1\n    cum_time &lt;- 0\n    for (step in seq(num_steps)) {\n        cum_time &lt;- cum_time + min(rlnorm(1, meanlog, sdlog), 200)\n        if (cum_time &gt;= max_seconds) { return(players$alive*0) }\n        if (sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 1)) { next }\n        if (sum(players$alive) == 0) { return(players$alive) }\n        players$alive[lead_player] &lt;- 0\n        lead_player &lt;- lead_player + 1\n    }\n    return(players$alive)\n}\n\nNow I can re-run all the trials and compute a new expected number of survivors:\n\n# Re-run trials\nnum_trials &lt;- 10000\nsims_timed &lt;- players[rep(seq(num_players), num_trials),]\nsims_timed[, trial := rep(seq(num_trials), each = num_players)]\nsims_timed[, alive := run_game_timed(\n    .SD, num_steps = 18, max_seconds = 16*60, meanlog, sdlog), by = trial]\n\n# Compute the new expected number of survivors across all trials\ntrials_counts_timed &lt;- sims_timed[, .(count = sum(alive)), by = trial]\nexpected_survivors &lt;- median(trials_counts_timed$count)\nexpected_survivors\n\n#&gt; [1] 5\n\n\nAs would be expected, the expected number of survivors decreased, which is now closer to the actual number of survivors in the show (3).\nBut how about the distribution? Well, by introducing time, all we’ve really done is modify the original distribution to be “zero-inflated” (which is super common in data sets you run across in the wild):\n\n# Plot the distribution of survivors across all trials\ntrial_count_timed_summary &lt;- as.data.frame(table(trials_counts_timed$count))\nnames(trial_count_timed_summary) &lt;- c(\"n_survivors\", \"count\")\nggplot(trial_count_timed_summary) +\n  geom_col(aes(x = n_survivors, y = count), width = 0.1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Outcomes of 10,000 trials\",\n    x = \"Number of survivors\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this also impacts the likelihood of survival for each individual player. As might be expected, zero-inflating the distribution of survivors simply reduces the probability of survival for all players, with the higher-number players still ranking the most likely to survive:\n\n# Plot the probability of survival based on the player order number\nsurvival_summary_timed &lt;- sims_timed[, \n    .(p_survive = sum(alive) / num_trials), by = player]\nggplot(survival_summary_timed) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = player, y = p_survive)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(16)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Probability of survival based on player order number\",\n    x = \"Player order number\",\n    y = \"Probability\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is of course is not quite what might be expected. Instead, I would expect the probability to be a tiny bit lower for the very last player or two as they could get left behind. But I chose to ignore feature as the lead player delay seemed to be a much bigger factor in determining survival. Plus, if you have an issue with how “realistic” my modeling is, I would encourage you to remember the context of this entire exercise (if you think anything about this is realistic, please see a psychiatrist).\n\n\nUpdate 2\nUpdated December 21, 2021\nLukas Gröninger wrote a similar post on his blog where he also provides the mathematical solution to the expected number of survivors - check it out!\n\n\nUpdate 3\nUpdated May 9, 2022\nHenk Tijms, Professor Emeritus at VU University Amsterdam, wrote a fantastic article introducing the concept of Markov Chains. In the article, he uses the Squid Game bridge scene as an example (along with several other classic probability problems, like Egg Russian Roulette) to demonstrate the power of Markov Chains. In his analysis he computes the expected number of survivors, the probability of survival for each player, and the probability distribution of the number of survivors.

    "text": "Image source: https://theawesomer.com/golf-chess-set/132440/\n\nIf you’ve been paying attention to AI progress in 2022, you almost certainly have heard of ChatGPT, an AI engine made by Open AI, that can generate remarkably detailed text and code to prompts. Like many, I wanted to test it out to see what it could come up with. This post summarizes the results of that experiment.\nThis initial post is based on the very first publicly available chat engine, ChatGPT, which is based on GPT3. In the future, I plan to update this post with responses from increasingly performant chat AIs to the exact same prompts.\n\nRound 1\nMy starting prompt for this post was quite simple:\n\nWrite a blog post arguing why chess is a much better game for people to adopt than golf.\n\nI chose this prompt for several reasons. First, it asks for an argumentative blog post, and I wanted to see how well the chat AI would do at coming up with some arguments for this topic. Second, I wanted to see what the AI would write on a topic that I haven’t seen someone else write about before. I tried to think of something relatively obscure, but specific enough that there might be some clear, logical arguments.\nBut most importantly, I wanted to see what specific arguments the AI would use. There are some rather obvious social and environmental aspects to this topic, such as the difference in resource requirements to play each game (golf, for example, requires a lot more land). Both games are also social activities, and both can be played across just about all ages. There are also mental and health benefits to each game. I was curious what arguments the AI would use with no further prompting.\nHere is what it produced based on the first prompt:\n\nChess and golf are both popular leisure activities that require strategy, skill, and mental focus. However, there are several reasons why chess is a much better game for people to adopt than golf.\nFirst, chess is a much more accessible and affordable game than golf. While golf requires expensive equipment and exclusive membership to a club or course, all you need to play chess is a chessboard and pieces, which can be purchased for a relatively low cost. Additionally, chess can be played anywhere, whether it’s at home, in a park, or online, while golf requires a dedicated course.\nSecond, chess is a more inclusive game than golf. Golf has a reputation for being a primarily wealthy and white-dominated sport, while chess has a more diverse player base and is more accessible to people of different socio-economic backgrounds.\nThird, chess has a range of benefits for the mind and body. Studies have shown that playing chess can improve problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and memory, as well as reduce the risk of developing conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Golf, on the other hand, has fewer cognitive benefits and requires more physical exertion, making it less suitable for those with mobility issues or disabilities.\nFinally, chess is a more universal and timeless game than golf. While golf is primarily popular in certain parts of the world and has a somewhat limited appeal, chess is played and enjoyed by people all over the globe, and its popularity has endured for centuries.\nIn conclusion, chess is a superior game to golf for several reasons. It is more accessible, inclusive, beneficial for the mind, and universal in its appeal. If you’re looking for a strategic and mentally stimulating activity, chess is the clear choice.\n\nOverall, not too shabby for a single-line prompt. But the post itself was rather simple and robotic. The writing structure is about as basic as you could get, and the arguments are all pretty obvious. For a grade school writing assignment, this would pass, but it’s nothing I would be excited about reading.\nThat said, I found it impressive that I didn’t even need to prompt it about including social aspects around this topic. The response highlighted the exclusivity of golf, and it also mentioned something about health benefits from chess.\nBut the biggest flaw I saw was the lack of any references to some of the claims in the post. In particular, the AI wrote a sentence stating that “studies have shown that playing chess can…reduce the risk of developing conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.” Any post that includes a line like that better have some references to those “studies.” So I updated my prompt asking explicitly for references. I also asked the AI to include details about the environmental impacts of golf as that is a well-known issue with the game.\n\n\nRound 2\nMy second prompt read:\n\nI want you to write me a blog post. This post should include technical details to support any arguments provided to it. The topic of the post is to argue why chess is a much better game for people to adopt than golf. Include details about the environmental damages from golf as well as information about the social dynamic of golf, such as networking benefits.\n\nHere is the response I got:\n\nCertainly, here is a blog post arguing why chess is a better game than golf:\nWhy Chess is a Better Game than Golf\nGolf is a popular leisure activity enjoyed by millions of people around the world, but it is not without its drawbacks. In contrast, chess is a game that offers numerous benefits and is a superior choice for those looking for a challenging and rewarding pastime.\nOne of the main criticisms of golf is its environmental impact, particularly with regard to land use. Golf courses require a significant amount of land to be developed and maintained, and this land is often taken from natural habitats. According to a study published in the Journal of Environmental Management, the average golf course in the United States occupies approximately 120 acres (48.5 hectares) of land (Karecha, Jorgensen, & Madsen, 2002). This land is often not available for other uses, such as agriculture or housing, leading to a loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity (Karecha et al., 2002). In addition, the chemicals used to keep the greens and fairways in pristine condition can have negative impacts on local ecosystems (Karecha et al., 2002). In contrast, chess requires no physical space or resources beyond a board and pieces, making it a more environmentally friendly option.\nGolf can also be a divisive and exclusive activity. Golf courses and club memberships are often expensive, making them out of reach for many people. This exclusivity can create a social hierarchy and foster a culture of elitism. In contrast, chess is a game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, backgrounds, and skill levels. It requires no special equipment or facilities, making it accessible to everyone.\nBut while golf may be traditionally seen as a game for social networking, chess can offer similar opportunities for social interaction and networking. Many chess clubs and organizations exist worldwide, providing a platform for people with a shared interest in the game to come together and socialize. These clubs often host tournaments and other events, providing opportunities for players to compete and meet new people. In addition, the internet has made it possible for chess players to connect and play with others online, further expanding the potential for social interaction and networking.\nPerhaps the most compelling reason to choose chess over golf is the cognitive benefits of the game. Chess is a highly strategic and challenging game that requires deep concentration and problem-solving skills. It has been shown to improve brain function, including memory, critical thinking, and decision-making skills (Gauthier, Tardif, & Belleville, 2010). In contrast, golf is often viewed as a leisurely activity that does not offer the same level of mental stimulation.\nIn conclusion, chess is a superior game to golf for a variety of reasons. It is environmentally friendly, particularly with regard to land use and chemical use, accessible to all, and offers significant cognitive benefits. It can also provide opportunities for social interaction and networking. If you’re looking for a challenging and rewarding pastime, consider giving chess a try. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy it.\nReferences:\nGauthier, S., Tardif, C., & Belleville, S. (2010). The benefits of chess for children’s cognitive and social development: A systematic review. Frontiers in Psychology, 1, 186. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00186\nKarecha, J., Jorgensen, B. E., & Madsen, J. (2002). The environmental impacts of golf courses: A review. Journal of Environmental Management, 66(3), 319-334. https://doi.org/10.1006/jema.2002.0490\n\nThese additions felt a lot more impactful than the original post in terms of writing a persuasive argument. I appreciated the inclusion of “facts” like the amount of land used for an average golf course, as well as references to support those “facts.”\nThe problem is these “facts” are fake. The references included look real, but they are both completely fabricated. The DOI links included are actually real DOIs, but they link to totally different and unrelated papers. So after reading this, I actually have no idea whether the average golf course in the U.S. is 120 acres, or whether golf courses lead to a “loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity.” The only way I can think to find out about whether these statements are true is to use an actual search engine like Google to search for real sources.\nI found this outcome deeply troubling. The overall writing was much better in this second round with a more detailed prompt, but the arguments are based on potentially false results with fabricated references.\nWhere this goes next is going to get really interesting. Will the next chat AI be able to include references to real research papers? Will the arguments become more nuanced? Will the output include more quantitative arguments, such as quantifying the reduction in biodiversity from golf courses (if that’s even true)? Given how quickly these models are developing I would not be surprised if the answer to all of the above is “yes”. Time will tell, and I will update this post when the next chat AI is made publicly available."

    "title": "{surveydown}: An open source, markdown-based survey framework (that doesn’t exist yet)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I do a lot of research using surveys. My current platform of choice is formr, a flexible platform for making surveys using  (see my blog post on how to use it to implement a choice-based conjoint survey). While formr is powerful in terms of it’s flexibility, it has a bit of a learning curve and isn’t the easiest tool for novices. And alternative platforms like Qualtrics, Google forms, etc. have their own issues, one of which is simply that they use a WYSIWYG interface, which makes it difficult to collaborate, version control, reproduce, etc.\nI want a markdown-based survey framework. Users should be able to draft plain text / markdown / RMarkdown files that can be compiled into a web-based survey. My inspiration is packages like {xaringan}, which compiles RMarkdown files into HTML presentation slides using remark.js.\nThis framework doesn’t yet exist (or at least I am not award of one that does), but I am confident we could relatively quickly build a working prototype. I’ve even got a name for it: {surveydown}\nSo this post is a call for help. I am laying out my goals for such a framework and asking if anyone out there wants to help take a crack at building it.\n\nUser interface\nMy prototype for a markdown-based survey framework would have the following features:\n\n1. All survey content is defined in plain text files (e.g. Rmd, yml, etc.)\n\n\n2. All survey questions are defined in a _questions.yml file\nHere’s an example:\n\nage:\n  type: numeric\n  required: true\n  text: \"What's your age?\"\n  option: 25\n\ngender:\n  type: mc\n  required: true\n  text: \"Which best describes your gender?\"\n  option:\n    - female: \"Female\"\n    - male: \"Male\"\n    - opt_out: \"Prefer not to say\"\n\nSome fields in this file might be:\n\ntype: Defines the type of question (e.g. numeric = a numeric entry box, mc = multiple choice, etc.).\nrequired: Respondent must answer the question to continue in the survey (defaults to false).\ntext: The question text.\noption: The set of choices for the question.\n\nThe names used for each question would be used as the column names in the resulting data file once respondents have completed the survey. For example, since I have two questions called age and gender, the resulting data might look something like this:\n\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 3\n#&gt;   respondent   age gender \n#&gt;        &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n#&gt; 1          1    25 female \n#&gt; 2          2    30 male   \n#&gt; 3          3    32 opt_out\n\n\nHere I am storing the option values (e.g. \"opt_out\") instead of the option labels (e.g. \"Prefer not to say\") in each cell, though this could be optional.\n\n\n3. All content displayed in the survey is defined in plain text / Rmd files\nFor example, a basic survey might have the following files:\n\nwelcome.Rmd: Basic welcome page.\nscreener.Rmd: Contains screen questions to filter out only elligible respondents.\nother.Rmd: Other questions for those who got through the screener.\nend.Rmd: Final survey page.\n\nThe welcome.Rmd file might have the following content:\n\n# Welcome!\n\n---\n\nThis is a survey!\n\nHere the --- symbol would indicate a page break in the survey, similar to how slide breaks work in {xaringan}.\n\n\n4. Survey questions are inserted with a simple interface, e.g. {{ }}\nFor example, a double curly bracket could be used to insert the age and gender questions, like this:\n\n{{ question age }}\n\n{{ question gender }}\n\nThis allows the survey designer the ability to separately handle the survey questions from all other content. That way they don’t have to dig through their Rmd files to edit the question labels or response options - they can just edit the _questions.yml file and everything else in the survey remains unchanged.\n\n\n5. Survey control logic is defined in a _survey.yml file\nIn this file, the user should be able to control the sequencing of the survey content, such as skipping questions depending on a specific response in a screener question. An example might be:\n\nsurvey:\n  welcome.Rmd\n  screener.Rmd\n  skip:\n    condition: age &gt; 40\n    distination: end_screen.Rmd\n  other.Rmd\n  end.Rmd\n  stop\n  end_sreen.Rmd\n  stop\n\nThe logic in this example would show the respondent the content in welcome.Rmd and screener.Rmd, and then it would evaluate the response to the age question (assuming it was shown in screener.Rmd). In this survey, the respondent is sent to the end_screen.Rmd page if their age is greater than 40, otherwise they would continue on to the other.Rmd and end.Rmd pages. A word like stop would be a special word that stops the survey at that point.\n\n\n6. Ability to run code in the survey\nThe ability to run code during a survey is perhaps the most promising aspect this framework. The formr platform can do exactly this, and it is the inspiration for why I feel this feature must be built into {surveydown} one way or another.\nHow to implement this is an open challenge. There are a number of ways to do it, and the exact implementation will probably depend on other aspects of how the package is built, but one idea is to leverage an idea related to child documents. I can imagine that users could make child Rmd files that contain code chunks that define aspects of questions, and then reference them in the _questions.yml file, something like this:\n\napples:\n  type: mc\n  text: \"What's your favorite apple?\"\n  child: /child/apples.Rmd\n\nWhat exactly would go in the /child/apples.Rmd file is yet to be defined, but it might require code chunks that contain {surveydown} functions for defining aspects of the question, such as the text, options, etc. This obviously has not yet been well thought out, but I mention it here as it is an important concept to keep in mind as other aspects of the framework are constructed.\n\n\n\nA quick prototype\nRather than start completely from scratch, I decided to build on the {shinysurveys} package (by Jonathan Trattner and Lucy D’Agostino McGowan) for a very quick prototype of this framework. My prototype is not at all complete - most of the features I have listed are not implemented. All it really does is allow the user to define questions in a _questions.yml file, and then runs a shiny app with those questions in series (so no Rmd files, page breaks, etc.). The code for this prototype can be found in the repo I set up for this project: github.com/jhelvy/surveydown\nThe _questions.yml file contains this:\n\nage:\n  type: numeric\n  required: true\n  text: \"What's your age?\"\n  option: 25\n\ngender:\n  type: mc\n  required: true\n  text: \"Which best describes your gender?\"\n  option:\n    - female: \"Female\"\n    - male: \"Male\"\n    - opt_out: \"Prefer not to say\"\n    - self_desc: \"Prefer to self describe\"\n\ngender_self_describe:\n  type: text\n  text: \"Which best describes your gender?\"\n  dependence: gender\n  dependence_value: \"Prefer to self describe\"\n\neducation:\n  type: select\n  text: \"What is the highest level of education you have attained?\"\n  option:\n    - hs_no: \"Did not attend high school\"\n    - hs_some:  \"Some high school\"\n    - hs_grad: \"High school graduate\"\n    - college_some: \"Some college\"\n    - college_grad: \"College\"\n    - grad: \"Graduate Work\"\n    - no_response: \"Prefer not to say\"\n\nrexper:\n  type: mc\n  text: \"Have you ever learned to program in R?\"\n  option:\n    - yes: \"Yes\"\n    - no: \"No\"\n\nWhen run, the basic example makes a shiny survey that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGif from https://vsgif.com/gif/2859497\n\n\n\nPlatforms\nOkay, I’ve got a very basic survey working in Shiny, but it’s far from complete. It doesn’t even have a database backend or anything - just a UI built from a _questions.yml file. And Shiny may not be the best platform to build this framework in - it’s just the first thing I found that I could quickly implement without having to learn too much. There are other options, and that’s where I would really like to hear from others about the best direction to go next.\nAt the highest level, I believe the goal should be to develop the framework as an R or python package. Since I prefer R and am more familiar with similar packages like {xaringan}, my starting point would be to develop an R package that uses R code to convert the text files defined by a user into the code for an online survey.\nThis framework could use a number of different underlying platforms though to implement the final survey. So in some ways we have to work backwards - find a platform we like that makes good surveys and supports an easy database backend for storing responses, then build the R (or python) package that converts the markdown text files into the code for that survey.\n\nShiny?\nShiny is a convenient package for building this framework as it already comes with all of the widgets needed for most types of survey questions. It’s also something that many R users (and a lot of academics who might make these surveys) already know. It has some simple and relatively streamlined approaches to hosting too, such as shinyapps.io. Finally, the ability to run code in the survey should also be relatively straightforward in Shiny.\nThe downside to working with shiny is that is isn’t really designed for collecting data as much as it is for displaying data. That said, one approach I have used in the past to store and manage data for a Shiny app is to hook it into a Google sheet. While it’s a little hacky, it might actually work okay for this context because surveys usually don’t require enormous sizes - the databases are often a few thousand rows at most and maybe tens to hundreds of columns (quite easily something a Google sheet could handle). I mean, Google uses sheets for Google forms, so why not? Airtable is another similar option here.\nSo Shiny is an option, and we could build upon / modify the {shinysurveys} package as a starting point. But a key question would be about the best way to integrate a database backend for managing responses.\n\n\nSurveyJS?\nI haven’t used it, but SurveyJS looks really nice. I imagine it wouldn’t be too difficult to write some R functions that convert markdown inputs into a SurveyJS survey. It looks like it may be more flexible than Shiny, and it seems to have lovely database backend integrations, but there would be a much larger learning curve to build it (at least for me…maybe a JS expert out there wants to take the lead?). It’s certainly doable. After all, {xaringan} uses reactjs, and Quarto surveys use revealjs…maybe {surveydown} should use SurveyJS?\nOne challenge it poses though is the ability to run code in the background. I don’t yet see a clear way to do something like run code chunks, so this feature may need to be cut to make it work.\n\n\nQualtrics? SurveyMonkey?\nThe survey gorillas like Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey are solid survey providers with loads of other features. Why reinvent the wheel? So another option is to build a package that does the translation of converting markdown files into something that is uploadable to one of these sites. I am not a big user of them, so I don’t even know if this is possible, but if it is then it would solve a lot of issues.\nSo in this case a {surveydown} package would really be a markdown-based framework to design and preview the survey UI. Once the user is happy with it, they would upload it to Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, etc. and field their survey.\nAn obvious downside is that it’s not open source (though I don’t think the entire toolchain needs to be for this to still be useful). Also, again the ability to run code in the survey may be lost, so that too is a considerable downside to this approach.\n\n\n\nPlease help!🙏\nIf you like this idea and want to contribute, I started a repo here: https://github.com/jhelvy/surveydown\nI include my basic Shiny example in the shiny-example folder. I’m not committed to using Shiny as the underlying platform, though I can at least envision how it might work.\nIf you have any thoughts on this, please do leave comments here or open an issue. I would love to see this framework built, and I think it could really improve and simplify the survey design process for many researchers.\nThanks for reading, and hopefully we’ll get this built one day!\n\n\nUpdate 1 (2023-06-15)\nAfter playing around with different versions of a UI, I’ve converged on a rather different approach to defining survey content. When using the UI originally described in this post, everything just felt too disaggregated. It lacked the cohesiveness that I love when, for example, making a presenting using {xaringan}. I missed having everything in a single RMarkdown file where the UI was much closer to literate programming.\nSo I’ve come up with a simpler UI. In this UI, you have a single survey.Rmd file (might also consider a .qmd Quarto file) where the survey theme and control logic is defined in a YAML at the top and all of the survey content is defined in the body. An example YAML might look like this:\n---\nname: \"surveydown demo\"\nauthor: \"John Paul Helveston\"\noutput:\n  surveydown::survey:\n    css:\n      - default\n    lib_dir: libs\n    control:\n      skip:\n        condition: color == \"Blue\"\n        destination: end_screenout\n      stop: end\n      stop: end_screenout\n---\nHere the surveydown::survey: section is where we could define all global options to the survey. I’ve added a control section to define flow logic. I could also imagine including a link to a database, etc.\nThen the body of the survey would feel just like a normal RMarkdown file. You could add any general markdown you want and insert questions using a code chunk with a question() function, something like this:\n```{r}\nquestion(\n  name     = 'color',\n  type     = 'mc',\n  required = TRUE,\n  label    = \"Do you want to take the red pill or the blue pill?\",\n  option   = c('Red', 'Blue')\n)\n```\nThe survey could be rendered into a view only mode with a simple function, like surveydown::render_survey(file = 'survey.Rmd'). Then to make the survey go live, it could be hosted on shinyapps.io (or a different server) with another function, maybe:\n\nsurveydown::host_survey(\n  folder = 'survey',\n  data_url = 'path_to_googlesheet',\n  api_key = 'api_key'\n)\n\nThis UI overall is much more simplified and allows for more complexity in how questions are defined. For example, you can write R code to define the options in a question, or you could read in a set of options from an external file.\nObviously a lot of work needs to be done to make something like this a reality, but it at least provides a goal."

SP data is often treated with suspicion because consumers may respond differently in a hypothetical survey context than they do in the marketplace. However, models built on RP data can suffer from endogeneity bias when attributes that drive consumer choices are unobserved by the modeler and correlated with observed variables. Using a synthetic data experiment, we test the performance of pooled RP–SP models in recovering the preference parameters that generated the market data under conditions that choice modelers are likely to face, including (1) when there is potential for endogeneity problems in the RP data, such as omitted variable bias, and (2) when consumer willingness to pay for attributes may differ from the survey context to the market context. We identify situations where pooling RP and SP data does and does not mitigate each data source’s respective weaknesses. We also show that the likelihood ratio test, which has been widely used to determine whether pooling is statistically justifiable, (1) can fail to identify the case where SP context preference differences and RP endogeneity bias shift the parameter estimates of both models in the same direction and magnitude and (2) is unreliable when the product attributes are fixed within a small number of choice sets, which is typical of automotive RP data. Our findings offer new insights into when pooling data sources may or may not be advisable for accurately estimating market preference parameters, including consideration of the conditions and context under which the data were generated as well as the relative balance of information between data sources.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{helveston2018pooling,\n  title={Pooling stated and revealed preference data in the presence of RP endogeneity},\n  author={Helveston, John Paul and Feit, Elea McDonnell and Michalek, Jeremy J},\n  journal={Transportation Research Part B: Methodological},\n  volume={109},\n  pages={70--89},\n  year={2018},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}"

Triangulating annual vehicle make and model sales data from 2003 to 2016 (plus monthly data from 2010 to 2016); 112 English and Mandarin archival documents from industry, academic, and news outlets; and 51 semi-structured interviews with industry, government, and academic stakeholders, we develop four in-depth case studies. We find that in contrast to the innovation trajectories of multinational and Chinese arms of joint venture (JV) firms, independent domestic Chinese firms (those with no history of international JV partnerships) are undertaking significant experimentation across multiple levels—infrastructure, core system, subsystem, and component—of the emerging PEV technology platform. We propose the concept of “institutional complementarities” to describe how interactions among institutions—here the national JV regulation and local market support and subsidies—may have turned regional markets into protected laboratories, extending the incubation periods for independent domestic firm experimentation. While this diverse experimentation may be an important antecedent of technology transition, consolidation induced by national policy standardization or competitive pressure may be required for PEV innovations to scale beyond their early, protected regional markets.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{helveston2019institutional,\n  title={Institutional complementarities: The origins of experimentation in China’s plug-in electric vehicle industry},\n  author={Helveston, John P and Wang, Yanmin and Karplus, Valerie J and Fuchs, Erica RH},\n  journal={Research Policy},\n  volume={48},\n  number={1},\n  pages={206--222},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}"

Prior research has found that direct experience with PEVs increases consumers’ stated purchase consideration, but these studies have used relatively long exposure times (days to months) with a PEV. To assess the effect of shorter exposure times (e.g. minutes) on stated purchase consideration, we conducted an experiment at the 2019 Washington D.C. Auto Show. Participants (n = 6518) were asked to rate their level of consideration to adopt a PEV before and after riding in one of four different PEVs for just 3–5 min. We find that the experience of riding in a PEV on average had a significant, positive effect on participants’ consideration ratings. We also find that the vast majority of respondents were unable to correctly answer basic knowledge questions about refueling a PEV and federal subsidies available for purchasing a PEV. These results suggest that while consumer knowledge about PEVs remains low, short rides or drives in a PEV could be an effective, more scalable strategy for increasing PEV consideration across larger populations.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{roberson2020electric,\n  title={Electric vehicle adoption: can short experiences lead to big change?},\n  author={Roberson, Laura A and Helveston, John P},\n  journal={Environmental Research Letters},\n  volume={15},\n  number={9},\n  pages={0940c3},\n  year={2020},\n  publisher={IOP Publishing}\n}"

EAF enables decision makers to explore alternative transition paths, thus providing several multi-step options to achieve a desired end state. These multi-step transition paths can be particularly valuable when they mitigate the impact of system degradation during the deployment of new capabilities. Additionally, EAF is formulated in a manner that empowers decision makers to apply decision variables, such as a cost cap or an equity metric, which are increasingly relevant to modern decision-making. To demonstrate the method and its value, we apply the EAF to a case study inspired by Los Angeles’ Vision 2028. We identify 26 transition paths across different performance dimensions. We model the cost and performance of each transition pathway and compare them using multiple measures, including traditional benefit-cost metrics and differential impacts on different stakeholder groups. Our results show that multi-step paths outperform single-step transitions to an end state (“big bang” approaches) in most scenarios. Multi-step paths also provide valuable alternatives when particular stakeholders value non-cost metrics.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{szajnfarber2021evolvability,\n  title={Evolvability analysis framework: Adding transition path and stakeholder diversity to infrastructure planning},\n  author={Szajnfarber, Zoe and Groover, Joshua A and Wei, Zhenglin and Broniatowski, David A and Chernicoff, William and Helveston, John P},\n  journal={Systems Engineering},\n  year={2021},\n  publisher={Wiley Online Library}\n}"

Here we assess the cost savings from a globalized solar photovoltaic (PV) module supply chain. We develop a two-factor learning model using historical capacity, component and input material price data of solar PV deployment in the United States, Germany and China. We estimate that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers US$24 (19–31) billion in the United States, US$7 (5–9) billion in Germany and US$36 (26–45) billion in China from 2008 to 2020 compared with a counterfactual scenario in which domestic manufacturers supply an increasing proportion of installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forwards from 2020 results in estimated solar module prices that are approximately 20–25 per cent higher in 2030 compared with a future with globalized supply chains. International climate policy benefits from a globalized low-carbon value chain, and these results point to the need for complementary policies to mitigate welfare distribution effects and potential impacts on technological crowding out.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{helveston2022nature,\n    author={Helveston, John Paul and He, Gang and Davidson, Michael R.},\n    title={Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains},\n    journal={Nature},\n    pages={1--5},\n    year={2022},\n    publisher={Nature Publishing Group UK London},\n    doi = {10.1038/s41586-022-05316-6}\n}"

The package is faster than other similar packages such as mlogit, gmnl, mixl, and apollo, and it supports utility models specified with “preference space” or “willingness to pay (WTP) space” parameterizations, allowing for the direct estimation of marginal WTP. The typical procedure of computing WTP post-estimation using a preference space model can lead to unreasonable distributions of WTP across the population in mixed logit models. The paper provides a discussion of some of the implications of each utility parameterization for WTP estimates. It also highlights some of the design features that enable logitr’s performant estimation speed and includes a benchmarking exercise with similar packages. Finally, the paper highlights additional features that are designed specifically for WTP space models, including a consistent user interface for specifying models in either space and a parallelized multi-start optimization loop, which is particularly useful for searching the solution space for different local minima when estimating models with non-convex log-likelihood functions.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{helveston2022jss,\n    author = {John Paul Helveston},\n    title = {logitr: Fast Estimation of Multinomial and Mixed Logit Models with Preference Space and Willingness to Pay Space Utility Parameterizations},\n    journal={Journal of Statistical Software},\n    url = {https://jhelvy.github.io/logitr/},\n    year = {2023},\n    volume = {105},\n    number = {10},\n    pages = {1--37},\n    doi = {10.18637/jss.v105.i10}\n}"

One particular area of concern is AVs’ impacts on public transit systems. If vehicle automation enables significant price decreases or performance improvements for ride-hailing services, some fear that it could undercut public transit, which could have significant implications for the environment and transportation equity. The extent to which individuals adopt automated transportation modes will drive many system-level outcomes, and research on public preferences for AVs is immature and inconclusive. In this study, we used responses from an online choice-based conjoint survey fielded in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region (N = 1,694) in October 2021 to estimate discrete choice models of public preferences for different automated (ride-hailing, shared ride-hailing, bus) and nonautomated (ride-hailing, shared ride-hailing, bus, rail) modes. We used the estimated models to simulate future marketplace competition across a range of trip scenarios. Respondents on average were only willing to pay a premium for automated modes when a vehicle attendant was also present, limiting the potential cost-savings that AV operators might achieve by removing the driver. Scenario analysis additionally revealed that for trips where good transit options were available, transit remained competitive with automated ride-hailing modes. These results suggest that fears of a mass transition away from transit to AVs may be limited by people’s willingness to use AVs, at least in the short term. Future AV operators should also recognize the presence of an AV attendant as a critical feature for early AV adoption.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{kaplan2023,\nauthor = {Leah Kaplan and John Paul Helveston},\ntitle ={Undercutting Transit?

Understanding PEV depreciation trends in comparison to those of conventional gasoline vehicles (CVs) is critical for assessing PEV affordability and informing relevant policy, such as subsidies for used PEVs. We deliver comprehensive, high-resolution estimates of value retention rates at the make-model level in the United States for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and CVs using a database of 9 million used cars listed online between 2016 and 2022. While BEVs and PHEVs have depreciated at faster rates than CVs, this trend is changing, with newer model year BEVs and those with larger ranges have significantly higher retention rates than older model years with smaller ranges. Tesla BEVs are a notable exception following the opposite trend, with earlier model years holding their value better than newer model years. Subsidized BEVs in the new market are associated with lower prices for the same model in the resale market, with the $7,500 federal subsidy translating to a 3% lower resale price on average. Finally, disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic have affected affordability across all vehicles, with mean listing prices rising 37% and 39% for CVs and BEVs, respectively, from January 2020 to March 2022 in inflation-adjusted 2019 dollars.\nBibtex:\n\n@article{roberson2024,\n    author={Roberson, Laura A. and Pantha, Saurav and Helveston, John Paul},\n    title={Battery-powered bargains?

If you are in the CS track, we recommend taking CSCI 6212 instead, or if you are in the EMSE track you can pick an EMSE course without prerequisites to take as an elective.\n\n\nWhat is the recommended sequence for part-time students taking 6 credits a semester?\n\nSemester 1:\n\nCSCI 6444 Introduction to Big Data and Analytics\nEMSE 6574 Programming for Analytics\n\nSemester 2:\n\nEMSE 6765 Data Analysis for Engineers and Scientists\nEMSE 6586 Data Management Systems for Data Analytics\n\nSemester 3:\n\nFirst Required Track Course (CSCI 6212 or EMSE 6575)\nElective\n\nSemester 4:\n\nSecond Required Track Course (CSCI 6364 or EMSE 6577)\nElective\n\nSemester 5:\n\nElective\nSEAS 6402 Data Analytics Capstone\n\n\n\n\nCan you help me understand the overall degree requirements?\nThe full requirements in the Bulletin are:\n\nComplete the five Required Courses\nComplete two Required Track courses for your focus area (CSCI 6212 and CSCI 6364 or EMSE 6575 and EMSE 6577)\nComplete one more Elective course in your track’s department at the 6000+ level\nComplete two additional electives. These can be 6000+ courses from any department, but if they are outside of CS or EMSE, then you need to get approval from your advisor first.\n\n\n\nDo I need to take CSCI 6362 Probability for Computer Science as a Prerequisite for CSCI 6364 Machine Learning?\nNo. This is not required as long as you have a statistics/probability course at the undergraduate level. Taking EMSE 6765 Data Analysis for Engineers and Scientists will also meet this need.\n\n\nCan you help me choose electives?\nIn general, any 6000 level course should generally be able to be counted for one of your two unrestricted electives. To find courses you may be interested in, check these resources:\n\nView the schedule of classes to see what will actually be offered in the semester you are interested in. Not all courses are offered every semester, and this is the best way to know what will actually be offered.\nView this Google sheet of common electives. While this list is not a comprehensive list of all electives, it does represent courses that DA students have taken in the past. It is a good list to start with when searching for electives, and it is continuously updated.\n\n\n\nHow many courses do I need in my focus area (CS or EMSE)?\nYou must take at least 3 courses in the track you have selected – two are required and the third is any of your choice from that department.\n\n\nCan I take course X which is not listed in the degree requirements?\nIf it is a 6000 level course, then generally yes it can be one of your two unrestricted electives. You should contact your advisor for approval first.\nYes, but you will need to fill out the CS Department’s Registration help form. Contact your advisor or cs@gwu.edu for more information.\n\n\nCan the SEAS 6402 DA Capstone course only be taken in Spring semesters?\nThe course is typically only offered in the spring, though some years we also offer a smaller fall section. You should not take 6402 until you have completed the other four required courses. If you start the program in Spring, then we recommend taking it in your 3rd semester (i.e., your second spring, a semester before graduation). If you are not able to take the course at the normal time, you should consult with your advisor before your last semester about completing the capstone as an independent project.\n\n\nI want to register for a 6000 level course, but I’m restricted, how do I register?\nSome courses have restrictions on who can register for a variety of reasons. Often times the restriction is due to missing prerequisite courses or the course is only offered to majors in that field (e.g. most courses in DATS are restricted to DATS majors). The best course of action depends on the specific situation. Here is some guidance:\n\nFor EMSE courses: Fill out an RTF and send it to Professor Helveston for approval.\nFor CSCI courses: Go to the CS Department’s Registration help form and fill out the request form.\nFor DATS courses: Fill out the Data Science Course Registration Request Form. If you’re unsure, you can also email DATS.\nFor any other course: Fill out an RTF and send it to the course instructor for approval. In these cases (especially if it’s a course outside of SEAS), also include a message as to why you want to enroll in the course.\n\nIn general, if there are prerequisite issues preventing you from registering, also explain in your email why you should be exempt from the prerequisite (e.g. you have prior experience or have taken a similar course, etc.). There are no guarantees that you will be allowed to enroll in the course, but following these steps is the best approach.\n\n\nI’m interested in becoming a Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant, how can I apply for one of these positions?\nGTA (teaching assistantship) positions are limited and typically offered to students later in the program (e.g. year 2) to GTA for a course they’ve already taken in their first year. There are not many of these available, and many are prioritized for PhD students over MS students since PhDs have longer tenures in SEAS (4-5 years) and because many will be in academic settings in their careers and therefore need more teaching experience. The best advice for these positions is to do an excellent job in the classroom and discuss with each faculty member you take a course with that has a GTA to see if you could take on a GTA position in the future. Directly expressing your interest to the faculty is the best thing you can do.\nGRA (research assistantship) positions are typically arranged on a faculty-by-faculty basis and usually supported by external research funding. The best way to find opportunities is to reach out to individual faculty and ask if there are potential GRA positions in their lab. It is also best to read up on the faculty member you are reaching out to to make sure their lab focuses on a topic that you are interested in and have something to offer. This isn’t limited to SEAS - you could be a GRA for a professor in a different school, and it is not strange for a DA student to use their skills in other domains, such as public health, the Elliott School, etc. Again, directly reaching out to faculty members is the best advise for obtaining one of these positions.\n\n\nI am looking for an internship or job in Data Analytics / Data Science, what should I do?\nFirst, reaching out to SEAS career services is a good idea. And it is also a good idea to get on Linkedin and get your CV / Resume setup so employers can find you.\nMeet ups: Beyond these channels, you can also significantly improve your chances of getting a position by networking with people in the DC area. For example, attend some of the Data Science DC meetups. Many of the participants are data professionals in the greater DC area and may know of a company hiring.\nOnline: You can also network online. Linkedin sometimes works, but joining Slack communities can also be a helpful way to connect with people. The Data Science Learning Community community, for example, has a very active Slack that you can join that is open to the public. The group was originally an R-focused group, but it is increasingly more diverse and has many resources on multiple languages, and they often post general jobs that are not language-specific.\nFinally, I would also recommend reading the book Build a Career in Data Science. The authors have many great suggestions and answer a lot of important questions about searching for and successfully finding a job in this field."

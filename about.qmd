Welcome! I am a researcher, economist, data geek, baker, dog mom, and Assistant Professor at Colorado State University. I study food retail markets, consumer food decisions, and food prices. Through projects like [DemocratizingData.ai](https://democratizingdata.ai/), I work to make information more transparent, equitable, and build to serve the public good. See my [CV](cv.qmd) for more details.

The Technology Change Lab conducts interdisciplinary research that explores relationships between technological change and factors that shape it, such as consumer behavior, market dynamics, and policy. We apply a systems engineering perspective to better understand these relationships and to inform policy, with an emphasis on accelerating transitions to cleaner technologies.


# Topics

- **Clean Technology Development & Adoption**: Quantify how consumers, firms, markets, and policy affect the nature & pace of transitioning to sustainable energy and transportation technologies.
- **Consumer Preferences for Emerging Technology**: Measure and model consumer preferences to assess policy and product design and simulate consumer choice behavior under uncertainty.
- **Electric Vehicles & Sustainable Transportation Technologies**: Assess barriers and opportunities to accelerating the development & adoption of sustainable transportation technologies.
- **U.S.-China Climate Relationship**: Study the critical relationship between the US and China in developing, scaling, and mass deploying low carbon energy technologies.

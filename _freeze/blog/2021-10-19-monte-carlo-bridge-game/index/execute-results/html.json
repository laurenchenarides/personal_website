The show is like a mixture of [Richard Connell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Connell)'s [The Most Dangerous Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Dangerous_Game), the [Hunger Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games), and the horror stories of [Edgar Allan Poe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe). It quickly became the #1 most most-watched show after just one week of being released.\n\n> SPOILER ALERT: I mention a few details in this post that might be spoilers if you haven't yet watched the show.\n\nIn Episode 7, the remaining 16 players play a game where they must cross a glass bridge with 18 steps. At each step, the lead player must choose between two glass panes -- one made of tempered glass strong enough to support two players, and the other of regular glass that will shatter if stepped on, in which case the player will plummet to their death. You can watch the scene [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19oFNytu0z0).\n\nWhen I watched the episode, I immediately started trying to calculate the expected number of survivors for the game. While seemingly straightforward, the problems is a bit more complex when you realize that each person behind the leader learns information from the leader's choices. That is, if the lead player chooses the \"not safe\" pane, that player dies, but every remaining player now knows which glass pane is \"safe\" at that step.\n\nRather than try and work the math, I decided to take a [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) approach -- just simulate a bunch of trials of the game, then count up how many players \"survived\" in each trial.\n\n# Defining the simulation\n\nThe first step I took in trying to simulate the game is to simplify the problem. The actual game has two glass panes (one \"safe\" and one \"not safe\") at each step in the bridge. This same situation can be modeled with a series of _single_ steps where the lead player has a 50% chance of surviving at each step. If the lead player steps on a \"not safe\" pane, we mark that player as dead and replace that pane with a \"safe\" one, allowing all remaining players to safely cross it. \n\nTo run a simulation, I first had to create the players, which I modeled using a simple data.table of 1s and 0s for \"alive\" and \"dead\". Everyone starts out alive.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create an initial data.table of players\nlibrary(data.table)\n\nnum_players <- 16\nplayers <- data.table(player = seq(num_players), alive = 1)\nplayers\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#>     player alive\n#>  1:      1     1\n#>  2:      2     1\n#>  3:      3     1\n#>  4:      4     1\n#>  5:      5     1\n#>  6:      6     1\n#>  7:      7     1\n#>  8:      8     1\n#>  9:      9     1\n#> 10:     10     1\n#> 11:     11     1\n#> 12:     12     1\n#> 13:     13     1\n#> 14:     14     1\n#> 15:     15     1\n#> 16:     16     1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo simulate a single game, I created a `run_game()` function that iterates through a specified number of bridge steps, each with a 50% chance of being \"safe\". The function iterates through each step until all \"safe\" panels are known, at which point the remaining \"alive\" players are assumed to all be able to safely finish crossing the bridge (I am assuming that all players have sufficient time to cross the bridge).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define a function for simulating one game\nrun_game <- function(players, num_steps) {\n    lead_player <- 1\n    for (step in seq(num_steps)) {\n        # 50% chance that the pane is safe\n        if (sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 1)) {\n            # The pane is safe, keep going!\n            next\n        } else {\n            # The pane broke ðŸ’€\n            # Before continuing, check if any players are still alive\n            if (sum(players$alive) == 0) { return(players$alive) }\n            # The lead player died\n            players$alive[lead_player] <- 0\n            lead_player <- lead_player + 1\n        }\n    }\n    return(players$alive)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nWith that, let's run one game of 18 steps and 16 players (same as in the show):\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Run one iteration of the game\nsingle_game <- run_game(players, num_steps = 18)\nsingle_game\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#>  [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo after one game, we had 4 survivors. But of course if we want to get an estimate of the _expected_ number of survivors, we need to run lots of trials of the game (a lot of bits are about to die).\n\n# Estimating the expected number of survivors\n\nI ran my trials inside a data.table, a simulation strategy I picked up from [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/) and his wonderful post on [efficient simulations in R](https://grantmcdermott.com/efficient-simulations-in-r/).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Run the main trials\n\n# Repeat the \"players\" data.table for each trial\nnum_trials <- 10000\nsims <- players[rep(seq(num_players), num_trials),]\n\n# Keep track of the trial number\nsims[, trial := rep(seq(num_trials), each = num_players)]\n\n# Now run the simulation for each trial\nsims[, alive := run_game(.SD, num_steps = 18), by = trial]\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn addition to being very fast, one really nice thing about running the trials using {data.table} is that you get all of the results back in a nicely-formatted data.table, which you can then use to compute all sorts of statistics. \n\nFor example, if you wanted to see the outcome of an individual trial, just filter for it:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# View one trial outcome\nsims[trial == 42]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#>     player alive trial\n#>  1:      1     0    42\n#>  2:      2     0    42\n#>  3:      3     0    42\n#>  4:      4     0    42\n#>  5:      5     0    42\n#>  6:      6     0    42\n#>  7:      7     0    42\n#>  8:      8     0    42\n#>  9:      9     0    42\n#> 10:     10     1    42\n#> 11:     11     1    42\n#> 12:     12     1    42\n#> 13:     13     1    42\n#> 14:     14     1    42\n#> 15:     15     1    42\n#> 16:     16     1    42\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf course, we can also use the trials to compute the expected number of survivors from the game. Since the outcomes are discrete, I take median number of survivors across all trials to reflect the expected number of survivors:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compute the expected number of survivors across all trials\ntrials_counts <- sims[, .(count = sum(alive)), by = trial]\nexpected_survivors <- median(trials_counts$count)\nexpected_survivors\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 7\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe simulation suggests that we should expect 7 players to survive when running a game with 16 players and 18 steps. When we look at the distribution of trial outcomes, we can also see that there is a pretty good chance of having 6 or 8 survivors in any one round of the game:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot the distribution of survivors across all trials\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ntrial_count_summary <- as.data.frame(table(trials_counts$count))\nnames(trial_count_summary) <- c(\"n_survivors\", \"count\")\n\nggplot(trial_count_summary) +\n  geom_col(aes(x = n_survivors, y = count), width = 0.1) + \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Outcomes of 10,000 trials\",\n    x = \"Number of survivors\", \n    y = \"Count\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Choose wisely\n\nWhile the expected number of survivors from these trials is higher than the actual number in the TV series (only 3 survive), keep in mind that these trials reflect ideal conditions in which all the players act strictly rationally. In the show, multiple players die as a result of the selfish or revengeful actions of other players, not strictly because of the breaking glass panes.\n\nBut perhaps the more important question from the perspective of the players is:\n\n> **\"Which number should I choose?\"** \n\nObviously choosing a larger number closer to the back of the line gives the player a higher probability of survival because the players in front identify all the \"safe\" glass panes. But how likely would you be to survive if you chose a number near the middle (which most players in the TV series chose first)?\n\nSince we have all the results of every trial outcome for every player in a convenient data.table, computing the probability of surviving for each player is straightforward:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot the probability of survival based on the player order number\nsurvival_summary <- sims[, .(p_survive = sum(alive) / num_trials), by = player]\n\nggplot(survival_summary) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = player, y = p_survive)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(16)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Probability of survival based on player order number\",\n    x = \"Player order number\", \n    y = \"Probability\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo even though the expected number of survivors is 7 out of 16 players, those survivors are overwhelmingly more likely to be the players who chose the highest order numbers.\n\n# How many steps to include?\n\nOne final question I had was what if the game designers chose to include more steps in the bridge? Because this was not supposed to be the last game, the designers needed to make sure at least **two** players survived, otherwise the games would simply end. \n\nWe can see from the previous simulations that with 16 players, the choice of 18 steps already puts a small (but non-zero) probability on having less than two survivors:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Probability of having less than two survivors\nsum(trials_counts$count < 2) / num_trials\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 0.0036\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf course this is probably an under-estimate of the true probability of having less than two survivors because the players are human beings who tend to make irrational choices when playing a deadly game (as we saw play out in the TV series version of the game).\n\nStill, what if the game designers were more risk seeking? How many steps could they include if they were willing to live with, for example, a 5% chance of having less than 2 players remaining at the end of the bridge game? \n\nTo answer that, we have to re-run our simulations, but with an increasing number of steps. To keep things simple, I run 1,000 iterations of the game over an increasing number of steps from 10 to 30:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Re-run the trials using an increasing number of bridge steps (10 to 30)\n\n# Repeat the \"players\" data.table for each trial\nmin_num_steps <- 10\nmax_num_steps <- 30\nstep_trials <- seq(min_num_steps, max_num_steps, by = 1)\nnum_step_trials <- length(step_trials)\nnum_trials <- 1000\nstep_sims <- players[rep(seq(num_players), num_trials*num_step_trials),]\n\n# Keep track of the trial number and the step number\nstep_sims[, trial := rep(seq(num_trials*num_step_trials), each = num_players)]\nstep_sims[, steps := rep(step_trials, each = num_players*num_trials)]\n\n# Now run the simulation for each trial\nstep_sims[, alive := run_game(.SD, num_steps = unique(steps)), by = trial]\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow I can compute the probability of having less than two survivors for each step size: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compute probability of having less than two survivors for each step size\nstep_counts <- step_sims[, .(count = sum(alive)), by = c(\"trial\", \"steps\")]\nstep_summary <- step_counts[, .(p_under2 = sum(count < 2) / num_trials), by = steps]\n\nggplot(step_summary) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = steps, y = p_under2)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = step_trials) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Probability of having less than two remaining players\",\n    x = \"Number of bridge steps\", \n    y = \"Probability\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI found it interesting that 18 steps seems to be the point at which the probability of having less than two remaining players begins to increase from essentially 0. With just a few more steps, the probability rapidly increases:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstep_summary[steps %in% seq(18, 23)]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#>    steps p_under2\n#> 1:    18    0.005\n#> 2:    19    0.008\n#> 3:    20    0.024\n#> 4:    21    0.040\n#> 5:    22    0.057\n#> 6:    23    0.107\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOkay, that's it! I'm sure I probably made an error somewhere - let me know if you find one, and hopefully this was an interesting example of how to conduct some relatively efficient Monte Carlo simulations in R with the help of the {data.table} package.\n\n# Update 1 - including time\n\n_Updated October 22, 2021_\n\nMany people on [twitter](https://twitter.com/JohnHelveston/status/1450830941056815105?s=20) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/comments/qcpckz/simulating_the_squid_game_bridge_scene_in_r/) had some great suggestions about this post. In particular, @evalparse had a [brilliant, one-line solution](https://twitter.com/evalparse/status/1450925271603843073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) for simulating the number of survivors in one game:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"evalparse.png\" width=400>\n</center>\n\nOne critique that was mentioned multiple times was that my simulations left out a critical element in the game: **time**. In the show, the players had just 16 minutes to cross the bridge, otherwise all of the glass panes shatter and anyone left behind dies. I originally omitted time for simplicity, but looking back at it now this is a pretty crucial element in the game because it means that the latter order numbers aren't necessarily so safe after all -- the further back in line you are, the higher risk you face of running out of time.\n\nSo, here's one attempt at including time in the simulation.\n\nMy immediate thought was to assume a distribution for the amount of time delay it takes for a player to take a step and then sample from that distribution for each player in each trial of the game. The key question is **what should that distribution look like?**\n\nObviously time needs to be positive, so I can't use distributions that could have negative numbers. But time also can't go on forever -- as we saw in the show, the people in the back of the line start to get impatient if the lead player takes too long and might \"encourage\" them to make a choice. \n\nSince I didn't have any real-world data to inform my decision (I sure hope there are no real-world data on this!), I decided to use the data from the show itself. I re-watched the scene and timed how long each lead player took to take a step. Time in the show isn't quite preserved because the camera cuts to other scenes, there's slow motion, etc., but many of the steps could be timed, so here's what I measured:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Lead player step times in seconds\nseconds <- c(36, 20, 25, 49, 66, 22, 112, 10, 115, 184, 144, 18, 22, 36, 28, 15, 10)\nsummary(seconds)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#>    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n#>   10.00   20.00   28.00   53.65   66.00  184.00\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMost lead players moved relatively quickly, with a median of just 28 seconds. But a few players took longer. In the show, player 9 (the bully guy) took quite a long time, and he might have taken longer if he wasn't forced to move by the woman he scorned.\n\nGiven these considerations, I chose to model the step time with a log-normal distribution because it prevents negative times and it has a long tail for those one or two players who might take a long time to move. Here are the parameters that fit these data, using the lovely `fitdistr()` function from the {MASS} package:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit <- MASS::fitdistr(seconds, \"log-normal\")\nfit\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#>     meanlog      sdlog  \n#>   3.5781872   0.8824273 \n#>  (0.2140201) (0.1513350)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's take a quick visual check of the fit:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmeanlog <- fit$estimate[1]\nsdlog <- fit$estimate[2]\nggplot() + \n    geom_histogram(aes(x = seconds, y = ..density..), \n                   binwidth = 10, fill = \"grey60\") +\n    geom_density(aes(x = rlnorm(1000, meanlog, sdlog)), color = \"red\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 200)) +\n    theme_bw() + \n    labs(\n        title = \"Log-normal fit of time delay for each lead player step\",\n        x = \"Time (seconds)\",\n        y = \"Density\"\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIs it a good fit? Eh, sort of? \n\nDo I have time to do a better job? Not really.\n\nOne issue with the log-normal though is that you can occasionally get a _really_ high number out on that long tail, which I would think is highly unlikely because at some point the next player is just going to push you off the bridge. So I censored my log-normal fit at 200 seconds. So, with this in mind, I created a new `run_game_timed()` function that includes a time delay for each step, sampling from a censored log-normal distribution. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Modified function for simulating one game with time\nrun_game_timed <- function(players, num_steps, max_seconds, meanlog, sdlog) {\n    lead_player <- 1\n    cum_time <- 0\n    for (step in seq(num_steps)) {\n        cum_time <- cum_time + min(rlnorm(1, meanlog, sdlog), 200)\n        if (cum_time >= max_seconds) { return(players$alive*0) }\n        if (sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 1)) { next }\n        if (sum(players$alive) == 0) { return(players$alive) }\n        players$alive[lead_player] <- 0\n        lead_player <- lead_player + 1\n    }\n    return(players$alive)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow I can re-run all the trials and compute a new expected number of survivors:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Re-run trials\nnum_trials <- 10000\nsims_timed <- players[rep(seq(num_players), num_trials),]\nsims_timed[, trial := rep(seq(num_trials), each = num_players)]\nsims_timed[, alive := run_game_timed(\n    .SD, num_steps = 18, max_seconds = 16*60, meanlog, sdlog), by = trial]\n\n# Compute the new expected number of survivors across all trials\ntrials_counts_timed <- sims_timed[, .(count = sum(alive)), by = trial]\nexpected_survivors <- median(trials_counts_timed$count)\nexpected_survivors\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs would be expected, the expected number of survivors decreased, which is now closer to the actual number of survivors in the show (3).\n\nBut how about the distribution? Well, by introducing time, all we've really done is modify the original distribution to be \"zero-inflated\" (which is _super_ common in data sets you run across in the wild):\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot the distribution of survivors across all trials\ntrial_count_timed_summary <- as.data.frame(table(trials_counts_timed$count))\nnames(trial_count_timed_summary) <- c(\"n_survivors\", \"count\")\nggplot(trial_count_timed_summary) +\n  geom_col(aes(x = n_survivors, y = count), width = 0.1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Outcomes of 10,000 trials\",\n    x = \"Number of survivors\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf course, this also impacts the likelihood of survival for each individual player.

Instead, I would expect the probability to be a tiny bit lower for the very last player or two as they could get left behind. But I chose to ignore feature as the lead player delay seemed to be a much bigger factor in determining survival. Plus, if you have an issue with how \"realistic\" my modeling is, I would encourage you to remember the context of this entire exercise (if you think _anything_ about this is realistic, please see a psychiatrist).\n\n# Update 2\n\n_Updated December 21, 2021_\n\nLukas GrÃ¶ninger wrote a [similar post](https://lukas-r.blog/posts/2021-12-05-looping-over-the-bridge/) on his blog where he also provides the [mathematical solution](https://lukas-r.blog/posts/2021-12-05-looping-over-the-bridge/#mathematical-solution) to the expected number of survivors - check it out!\n\n# Update 3\n\n_Updated May 9, 2022_\n\n[Henk Tijms](https://personal.vu.nl/h.c.tijms/), Professor Emeritus at VU University Amsterdam, wrote a [fantastic article](https://kraket.genkgoweb.com/en/sector/article/2021-12-20-markov-changed-the-world/) introducing the concept of Markov Chains. In the article, he uses the Squid Game bridge scene as an example (along with several other classic probability problems, like Egg Russian Roulette) to demonstrate the power of Markov Chains. In his analysis he computes the expected number of survivors, the probability of survival for each player, and the probability distribution of the number of survivors. The Squid Game example starts on page 7.\n\n# Appendix\n\nHere is the combined code for this entire simulation:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Rmd

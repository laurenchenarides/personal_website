We'll use a Shiny app to visualize the payback periods and long-term savings for each option.\n\n## The Analysis\n\nTo make this analysis interactive and easily adjustable, I've created a Shiny app that calculates and visualizes the costs and savings for each option. You can adjust the parameters to see how different scenarios affect the outcomes.\n\n\n::: {.cell .panel-sidebar}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nplotColors <- c(\"dodgerblue\", \"firebrick\")\n\n# Include the contents of your functions.R file here\ncalculate_fuel_cost <- function(fuel_price, mpg) {\n    fuel_price / mpg\n}\n\ncalculate_savings_per_mile <- function(current_van_fuel_cost, new_vehicle_fuel_cost) {\n    current_van_fuel_cost - new_vehicle_fuel_cost\n}\n\ncalculate_payback_period <- function(new_vehicle_cost, trade_in_value, annual_miles, savings_per_mile) {\n    net_cost <- new_vehicle_cost - trade_in_value\n    years_to_payback <- net_cost / (annual_miles * savings_per_mile)\n    years_to_payback\n}\n\nvehicle_cost_analysis <- function(current_van_mpg, new_vehicle_cost, new_vehicle_mpg, \n                                  trade_in_value, gas_price, electricity_price, \n                                  leaf_miles_per_kwh, annual_miles, is_electric = FALSE) {\n    current_van_fuel_cost <- calculate_fuel_cost(gas_price, current_van_mpg)\n    \n    if (is_electric) {\n        new_vehicle_fuel_cost <- electricity_price / leaf_miles_per_kwh\n    } else {\n        new_vehicle_fuel_cost <- calculate_fuel_cost(gas_price, new_vehicle_mpg)\n    }\n    \n    savings_per_mile <- calculate_savings_per_mile(current_van_fuel_cost, new_vehicle_fuel_cost)\n    payback_period <- calculate_payback_period(new_vehicle_cost, trade_in_value, annual_miles, savings_per_mile)\n    \n    list(\n        current_van_fuel_cost_per_mile = current_van_fuel_cost,\n        new_vehicle_fuel_cost_per_mile = new_vehicle_fuel_cost,\n        savings_per_mile = savings_per_mile,\n        annual_savings = savings_per_mile * annual_miles,\n        payback_period_years = payback_period\n    )\n}\n\n# Include the contents of your app.R file here\nui <- fluidPage(\n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n            numericInput(\"current_van_mpg\", \"Current Van MPG\", value = 18, min = 0),\n            numericInput(\"leaf_cost\", \"Nissan Leaf Price ($)\", value = 5000, min = 0),\n            numericInput(\"hybrid_cost\", \"Hybrid Minivan Price ($)\", value = 50000, min = 0),\n            numericInput(\"hybrid_mpg\", \"Hybrid Minivan MPG\", value = 45, min = 0),\n            numericInput(\"trade_in_value\", \"Current Van Trade-in Value ($)\", value = 18000, min = 0),\n            numericInput(\"gas_price\", \"Gas Price ($/gallon)\", value = 3.00, min = 0, step = 0.01),\n            numericInput(\"electricity_price\", \"Electricity Price ($/kWh)\", value = 0.14, min = 0, step = 0.01),\n            numericInput(\"leaf_miles_per_kwh\", \"Leaf Miles per kWh\", value = 3.5, min = 0, step = 0.1),\n            numericInput(\"annual_miles\", \"Annual Miles\", value = 8000, min = 0)\n        ),\n        \n        mainPanel(\n            h3(\"Results\"),\n            verbatimTextOutput(\"results\"),\n            plotOutput(\"comparison_plot\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n    # Server logic remains the same as in your app.R file\n    # ...\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Interpretation\n\nThe Shiny app above allows us to compare the costs and potential savings of three vehicle options:\n\n1. Keeping the current van\n2. Buying a Nissan Leaf as an additional vehicle\n3. Trading in the current van for a new hybrid minivan\n\nBy adjusting the parameters, we can see how factors like gas prices, electricity costs, and annual mileage affect the payback period and long-term savings for each option.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis analysis provides a framework for making an informed decision about vehicle choices based on cost-effectiveness. However, it's important to note that this model focuses primarily on fuel costs and doesn't account for other factors such as maintenance costs, insurance, or the convenience of having an additional vehicle.\n\nYour specific circumstances and priorities will ultimately guide your decision. This tool simply aims to provide a clearer picture of the financial implications of each option over time.\n\nFeel free to play around with the parameters in the Shiny app to see how different scenarios might affect the outcomes!\n",

Much of the platform architecture has changed since then, so check the [documentation](https://surveydown.org/documentation) for the latest correct information.**\n\n:::\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"logo.png\" width=200>\n</center>\n<br>\n\nYou may have read my [previous blog post](https://jhelvy.com/blog/2023-04-06-markdown-surveys/) about an R packaged I called \"surveydown\". That post described some ideas I was thinking about for a package that would allow people to design surveys using markdown and R. But the package didn't exist yet, it was just an idea. \n\nWell, I have good news: **the package now exists!** \n\nIn this post, I'm going to show you a quick overview of the {surveydown} R package for making markdown-based surveys as well as a little about _why_ we built surveydown.\n\n# A new way to design surveys\n\n[surveydown](https://surveydown.org/) is a flexible platform for making surveys in {{< fa brands r-project >}} using three open source technologies:\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), and\n[supabase](https://supabase.com/). The package is still in development, but you can already use it to create surveys. \n\n<br>\n<center>\n<img src=\"technologies.png\" width=600>\n</center>\n<br>\n\nThe basic concept is this:\n\n1.  Design your survey as a [Quarto shiny\n    document](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/interactivity/shiny-r.html)\n    using markdown and R code.\n2.  Render your doc into a [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app that can\n    be hosted online and sent to respondents.\n3.  Store your survey responses in a [supabase](https://supabase.com/)\n    database.\n\nIn surveydown, your entire survey is designed using markdown and R code in a single Quarto document. There is no GUI or drag-and-drop interface - simply write plain text (markdown and R code) and boom - you have a survey! \n\nThe [{surveydown} package](https://pkg.surveydown.org/) provides a set of functions for defining the survey content and control logic. Each function starts with `sd_` to make them easy to identify. You can add content to your survey using markdown formatting, or in RStudio you can edit with the visual editor. Survey questions are defined in R code chunks with the `sd_question()` function. Pages are defined using fences (`:::`), and navigation buttons handled with the `sd_next()` function. You can modify the control logic in the server code chunk (the last code chunk at the bottom of the .qmd file) with the `sd_config()` function, and you can configure the database with the `sd_database()`. \n\nThe [documentation](https://surveydown.org/) has many more details on all of this, and later in this post I'll give a quick overview of a few of these features. But first, let me tell you a little about _why_ we decided to build surveydown.\n\n# Why did we build surveydown?\n\n> Do we really need another survey platform?\n\nI do a lot of survey research, and I've been frustrated with the survey platforms I've used in the past. The commerical platforms like Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey are great, but they are expensive and are difficult to version control, and collaboration with others is near impossible, especially if your collaborator doesn't have a license of their own. They also don't allow me to own my own survey data, meaning I always am at the mercy of the platform owner. And the features are often limited. It's not easy to do more complex things like randomization, conditional display, etc.\n\nThe only other open-source survey platform I have used is [formr](https://formr.org/), which is a very powerful platform, but it is rather clunky to use (you define your survey in Google sheet cells...there's a learning curve), and it is not as easy to edit as a simple markdown file. \n\nWhat we've come up with is a survey platform that is flexible, _relatively_ easy to use, and built entirely with open-source technologies. I think it solves a lot of problems, and hopefully someone out there will find it useful.\n\n## Open source\n\nsurveydown is built entirely with open-source technologies, making it transparent and customizable. Best of all, no expensive licenses! Just install and use it! \n\n## Own your data\n\nWith surveydown, you retain full ownership and control of your survey data. The responses are stored in your own Supabase database, ensuring that you have complete access to the data. This is particularly important for researchers dealing with sensitive information or those who need to comply with specific data protection regulations. We're still working on enabling you to use your own hosted database, which will provide even more flexibility.\n\n## Ease of editing\n\nDesigning a survey in surveydown is a pretty straightforward process. The markdown-based approach allows for quick modifications and easy navigation through your survey. And since it's built on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), you can use all of the features of Quarto to make your survey look great, like changing the theme, adding custom CSS, etc. You can also easily preview your survey as you edit it, and even run your survey locally to test it out before you deploy it, either with a button click in RStudio or with a `quarto serve` command in the terminal.\n\n## Did I mention you can run R code in your survey?\n\nEvery surveydown survey uses R code chunks for questions. But you can also insert R code for all sorts of other things. For example, if you wanted to randomize the values shown in a question, you could write some R code for that. Want to insert a plot of something? Write a little ggplot code. You can also add interactive components to your surveys, such as showing a respondent how their responses compare to others in real time.\n\n## Easy version control and collaboration\n\nBecause the entire survey is defined in a single plain text file, surveydown naturally integrates with version control systems like Git. This allows you to track changes over time, collaborate with team members, and maintain a clear history of your survey's development.\n\n## Reproducible\n\nSurveydown promotes reproducible research by allowing you to define your entire survey in a single, self-contained plain text document. This has a ton of benefits:\n\n- Want someone else to be able to reproduce your experiment? Just give them the .qmd file and any other files they need (e.g., images, data, etc.), and they can reproduce your survey on their own computer.\n- Want to print out your survey for an appendix? Render the survey with all pages visible then print it to pdf.\n- Want others to see your survey live? Just set the database into pause mode and your survey will function without recording any responses.\n\nReproducibility is something we had in mind from the start with this project, and we've tried to make it as easy as possible for your surveydown surveys to be fully reproducible.\n\n# Introduction to surveydown\n\n## Getting started \n\nAfter getting everything [installed](https://surveydown.org/installation), we recommend starting with a template survey project. To do so, run the following in the R console:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsurveydown::sd_create_survey(\"path/to/folder\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis will create a folder with the following files:\n\n- `example.qmd`: a template survey you should edit.\n- `example.Rproj`: An RStudio project file (helpful if you're working in RStudio)\n- `_extensions`: A folder with the [surveydown Quarto extension](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown-ext) needed to make everything work (don't modify this).\n\nIf you have the example open in RStudio, you can click the \"Run document\" button, or in your terminal run `quarto serve example.qmd`. Either approach should render the example survey into a shiny app that you can preview in a browser. Don't worry just yet about setting up your database or making the survey live - for now, we're going to focus on designing the survey and running it locally to preview it. The example survey should look like this:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"example.png\" width=700>\n</center>\n\n## Adding pages\n\nIn surveydown, pages are delineated using \"fences\", like this:\n\n```\n::: {#welcome .sd-page}\n\nPage 1 content here\n\n:::\n\n::: {#page2 .sd-page}\n\nPage 2 content here\n\n:::\n```\n\nAs you can see, we use three colon symbols `:::`, called a \"fence\", to mark the start and end of pages. This notation is commonly used in Quarto for a variety of use cases, like defining [subfigures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#subfigures) in images.\n\nIn the starting fence, you need to define a page name (e.g. `welcome` and `page2` in the example above) and you need to define the class as `.sd-page`. Then anything you put between the page fences will appear on that page. \n\nTo navigate to the next page, you need to insert a `sd_next()` function call inside a code chunk, like this: \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\nsd_next(next_page = 'page2')\n```\n````\n:::\n\n\n\nThe above code chunk will create a \"Next\" button that goes on to page 2 that looks like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div data-next-page=\"page2\" style=\"margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-default action-button sd-enter-button\" id=\"page_id_next\" onclick=\"Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;next_page&#39;, this.parentElement.getAttribute(&#39;data-next-page&#39;));\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" type=\"button\">Next</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou would need to place the code chunk in between the `:::` fences of the `welcome` page in order to have a \"Next\" button that goes on to page 2. You can also send the user to other pages by just changing the `next_page` argument. Finally, you can also change the label of the button by changing the `label` argument, like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\nsd_next(next_page = 'page2', label = 'Next page')\n```\n````\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div data-next-page=\"page2\" style=\"margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-default action-button sd-enter-button\" id=\"page_id_next\" onclick=\"Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;next_page&#39;, this.parentElement.getAttribute(&#39;data-next-page&#39;));\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" type=\"button\">Next page</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Adding questions\n\nEvery survey question is created using the `sd_question()` function inside a code chunk. The question type is defined by the `type` argument. For example, to add a multiple choice question, you could insert the following code chunk:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'penguins',\n  label = \"Which is your favorite type of penguin?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',\n    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',\n    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'\n  )\n)\n```\n````\n:::\n\n\n\nThe above code chunk will create a multiple choice question that looks like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"container-penguins\" data-question-id=\"penguins\" class=\"question-container\" style=\"width: 100%;\" oninput=\"Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;penguins_interacted&#39;, true, {priority: &#39;event&#39;});\">\n<div id=\"penguins\" class=\"form-group shiny-input-radiogroup shiny-input-container\" role=\"radiogroup\" aria-labelledby=\"penguins-label\">\n<label class=\"control-label\" id=\"penguins-label\" for=\"penguins\"><p>Which is your favorite type of penguin?</p>\n</label>\n<div class=\"shiny-options-group\">\n<div class=\"radio\">\n<label>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"penguins\" value=\"adelie\"/>\n<span>Adélie</span>\n</label>\n</div>\n<div class=\"radio\">\n<label>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"penguins\" value=\"chinstrap\"/>\n<span>Chinstrap</span>\n</label>\n</div>\n<div class=\"radio\">\n<label>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"penguins\" value=\"gentoo\"/>\n<span>Gentoo</span>\n</label>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"hidden-asterisk\">*</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `sd_question()` function can be used to create a variety of [question types](https://surveydown.org/questions), like text input, select drop down choices, and more by changing the `type` argument.\n\nThe function has many other arguments for customizing the look and feel of the question (e.g., `height` and `width`, etc.).\n\n## The server chunk\n\nAt the very bottom of the .qmd file is a special \"server\" code chunk (that's the `#| context: server` bit) that defines the app server. This is where you can customize and control the survey flow logic as well as where you define the database that will store the survey response data. It looks like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell context='server'}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\n#| context: server\n\n# Define the database settings\ndb <- sd_database()\n\n# Define the configuration settings\nconfig <- sd_config()\n\n# The sd_server() function initiates your survey - don't change this\nsd_server(\n  input   = input,\n  session = session,\n  config  = config,\n  db      = db\n)\n```\n````\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `sd_database()` function is where you set up your database. The `sd_server()` function makes everything run, which you can safely ignore - just don't change it and all will be good!\n\nThe middle part (the `sd_config()` function) is where you can define custom control logic for the survey, such as [*conditional display*](#conditional-display) (conditionally displaying a question based on responses to questions), or [*conditional skip*](#conditional-skip) (conditionally sending the respondent to a page based on responses to questions).\n\n## Going live!\n\nOnce you are happy with your survey, you can deploy it live to any server of your choice. Since it's a shiny app, you can [deploy it to shinyapps.io](https://surveydown.org/deployment) for free! \n\n# Features\n\nSince surveydown is built on top of Shiny, it provides tremendous flexibility in terms of what you can do with your survey. Below are a few examples of some commons things you may want to do with your survey.\n\n## Conditional display\n\nLet's say we had a fourth option for \"other\" in our multiple choice question about penguins. If the respondent chose it, you may want a second question to popup that allows them to specify the other penguin type. To implement this, you would need to define both questions, e.g.:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'penguins',\n  label = \"Which is your favorite type of penguin?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',\n    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',\n    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo',\n    'Other'     = 'other'\n  )\n)\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = \"text\",\n  id    = \"penguins_other\",\n  label = \"Please specify the other penguin type:\"\n)\n```\n````\n:::\n\n\n\nThen in the server code chunk, you could use the `show_if` argument to define that the `penguins_other` question would only be shown if the respondent chose the `other` option in the `penguins` question, like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconfig <- sd_config(\n  show_if = tibble::tribble(\n    ~question_id,  ~question_value, ~target,\n    \"penguins\",    \"other\",         \"penguins_other\"\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis will make the `penguins_other` question only appear if the respondent chose the `other` option in the `penguins` question, like this:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"show_if.gif\" width=600 style=\"box-shadow: 0 8px 12px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 5px;\">\n</center>\n<br>\n\nHere we're using the `tibble::tribble()` function to define a data frame with three columns:\n\n- `question_id`: The `id` of the triggering question.\n- `question_value`: The triggering value.\n- `target`: The `id` of the target question to display.\n\nYou don't have to use `tibble::tribble()`, and in fact if you have a lot of `show_if` conditions, then you could create a csv file with all of your conditions in it and read it in to set the `show_if` conditions (just make sure the header has the same three column names), e.g.:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconfig <- sd_config(\n  show_if = readr::read_csv('path/to/show_if_conditions.csv')\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Conditional skip\n\nOften times you'll want to screen people out of a survey based on responses to questions. For example, let's say you only wanted to only include people who own a vehicle. On your first page (e.g., with page name `welcome`), you could screen out people who do _not_ own a vehicle.\n\nFirst, define a question about their vehicle ownership, e.g.:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'vehicle_ownership',\n  label = \"Do you own your vehicle?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Yes' = 'yes',\n    'No'  = 'no'\n  )\n)\n```\n````\n:::\n\n\n\nThen in the server code chunk, you could use the `skip_if` argument in `sd_config()` to define the behavior of the next button on the `welcome` page, like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconfig <- sd_config(\n  skip_if = tibble::tribble(\n    ~question_id,        ~question_value, ~target,\n    \"vehicle_ownership\", \"no\",            \"screenout\"\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis sets up a condition where if the respondent chooses `no` on the `vehicle_ownership` question, they will be sent to a page named `screenout`. You could put such a page at the end of the survey, something like this:\n\n```\n::: {#screenout .sd-page}\n\nSorry, but you are not qualified to take our survey.\n\n:::\n```\n\nNotice that I don't have a `sd_next()` on this screenout page. That is how you define an end point for the survey taker. If there's no \"Next\" button, then they cannot navigate anywhere else, so the survey is over.\n\n## Required responses\n\nBy default, no questions are required. However, you can make questions required by adding the question `id` to the `required` argument in `sd_config()`, like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconfig <- sd_config(\n  required_questions = c(\"vehicle_ownership\", \"penguins_other\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis will make the respondent unable to proceed until they have answered the required questions. It will also place a red asterisk (*) next to the question label to indicate that the question is required.\n\nYou can also make all questions required by setting `all_questions_required = TRUE` like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconfig <- sd_config(\n  all_questions_required = TRUE\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Reactivity\n\nOne other feature that is particularly powerful is the ability to use R code in your survey via Shiny's reactive programming. This allows you to make your survey more interactive and to use the full power of R to create custom functionality.\n\n### Demo 1: Displaying content based on previous responses\n\nLet's say you wanted to create a survey that asked the respondent's name, and then displayed a personalized message based on their name. You could do this by first asking their name:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd_question(\n  type  = \"text\",\n  id    = \"name\",\n  label = \"What is your name?\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThen you can use the `sd_display_value(\"name\")` function to display the value of the `name` question in other parts of your survey. For example:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nWelcome, `r sd_display_value(\"name\")`!\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhich would render as something like \"Welcome, Dave!\" (assuming the respondent entered \"Dave\" in the `name` question). This works because the `sd_display_value()` function is reactive, meaning it will update the display based on the respondent's responses.\n\n### Demo 2: Displaying randomized question labels\n\nLet's say you wanted to show a series of questions, but you wanted to randomize the labels shown for each question. You could do this by first defining a list of labels, and then using the `sd_question_reactive()` function to create a question that will display a random label from the list. \n\nFor example, let's ask the respondent to rate different car brands from a random set of brands. You could first pre-define the randomized sets of brands for each respondent and store it as a csv file, like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbrands <- c(\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Chevrolet\", \"Honda\", \"Nissan\", \"Tesla\")\ndesign <- data.frame(\n  respondent_id = rep(1:10, each = 3),\n  brand = unlist(lapply(1:10, function(x) sample(brands, 3, replace = FALSE)))\n)\nwrite_csv(design, \"design.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis would make a design file that looks like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  respondent_id     brand\n1             1     Honda\n2             1    Nissan\n3             1      Ford\n4             2      Ford\n5             2    Toyota\n6             2 Chevrolet\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that this would not be done in your survey.qmd file - it's just a one-time thing to create the design (probably stored in an R file).\n\nThen in your server code chunk, you could read in the design file and use it to randomize the labels for each question based on a randomly chosen respondent:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndesign <- read_csv(\"design.csv\")\nresp_id <- sample(design$respondent_id, 1)\ndf_resp <- design %>% filter(respondent_id == resp_id)\n\noptions <- c(1, 2, 3)\nnames(options) <- df_resp$brand\n\nsd_question_reactive(\n  type  = \"mc\",\n  id    = \"brands\",\n  label = \"Which of these brands do you like best?\",\n  option = options\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nHere the `sd_question_reactive()` function is used because the labels depend on the randomly chosen respondent. This means the labels will be different for each respondent.\n\nSince this is a reactive question, **this code must be placed inside the server code chunk**, not where you want it to appear in the survey. To define where in the survey the question should appear, you use the `sd_display_question()` function with the `id` set to the same value as the `id` in the `sd_question_reactive()` function, like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd_display_question(id = \"brands\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow the `brands` question will be displayed in the survey where you put this code chunk.\n\nNote that all question responses are automatically saved to the database, but if you wanted to store some other value (e.g. the randomly chosen `respondent_id`), you could do that with the `sd_store_value()` function, like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd_store_value(resp_id)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# How we built it\n\nBefore I wrap up, I just want to say that I am absolutely amazed at the time we live in. I have had this idea in mind for many years, but I'm not a web developer, and I never could come up with a way to make it happen. That was actually what motivated me to write my [previous blog post](https://jhelvy.com/blog/2023-04-06-markdown-surveys/) - it was a call for help from others!\n\nBut two things happened relatively recently that made it possible:\n\n1. The rise of Quarto\n2. The rise of LLMs\n\nAfter I switched my website over from distill to Quarto, I began to learn more and more about how powerful Quarto really is for building things on the web. Then I saw the [Quarto shiny document](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/interactivity/shiny-r.html) framework and I immediately thought that this just might be the missing piece I needed to make surveydown a reality. It does all the legwork of converting markdown and R code into a shiny app. \n\nOf course, implementing this idea was still really, really hard. There were many different ways to start, and I got some [excellent feedback](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/6975) from people in the R / Quarto dev community. Garrick Aden-Buie in particular was the first to [propose the idea of using fences](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/6975#discussioncomment-8828907) to denote page breaks, which was a big breakthrough early on. \n\nBut the biggest breakthrough came when I started using GPT-4 to help me brainstorm many different ideas while developing the overall platform architecture. [This conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/57fda3b1-2e76-4ab1-b7af-e53eac597986) in particular was game changing. In it, I came to solutions for multiple complex problems, including the page navigation logic and which platform to use for the database (we originally started with using Googlesheets, but ultimately decided on Supabase because it is open-source and just far easier to use).\n\nOf course, the AI didn't do everything. Two of my students, [Pingfan Hu](https://github.com/pingfan-hu) and [Bogdan Bunea](https://github.com/Buneabt) have been instrumental in helping implement many of the features the package now has, and they too have leveraged LLMs to accelerate their problem solving. Thank you guys for all of your hard work! 🙏\n\nIt's been amazing watching this project come together over such a short period of time. The original conversations I had with GPT-4 and others in the R / Quarto community were just in March and April of this year (2024). We really didn't start developing in earnest until the summer, and really only late June / early July at that. In just a few months, we've gone from an idea to a fully functional survey platform.\n\nIf you give surveydown a try, please let us know what you think! And if you find a bug or something you wished existed, please post an issue on [github](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown/issues).\n\nI'm so excited to see what you all will build with surveydown!\n",

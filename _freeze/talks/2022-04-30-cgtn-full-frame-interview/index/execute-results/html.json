In the [interview](https://www.cgtnnow.com/videos/full-frame-going-green), I discuss some of the challenges and opportunities China faces in the race to decarbonize it's energy systems. I also discuss the critical role China is playing in scaling up the mass production of low carbon energy technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries, and electric vehicles. My interview starts at minute 30:45 in the show, which you can watch [here](https://www.cgtnnow.com/videos/full-frame-going-green).\n",

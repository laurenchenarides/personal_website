You can watch the recording below.\n\n**About the webinar**:\n\nThe auto industry is on the cusp of its greatest transformation in more than a century, shifting from internal combustion engines to electric motors powered by lithium-ion batteries. China, which already plays an important role in global auto supply chains, has been the first mover in this transformation, sparking concerns in the United States and elsewhere. This session will explore the United States’ proposed response to this challenge and its profound links to both long-run economic prosperity and the future of the planet.\n\n**Moderator**: [John Paul Helveston](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/john-helveston), Assistant Professor, Engineering Management & Systems Engineering, George Washington University\n\n**Administration Presenter**: [Susan Helper](https://faculty.weatherhead.case.edu/helper/), Senior Economist, White House Council of Economic Advisers\n\n**Discussants**:\n\n- [George W.
